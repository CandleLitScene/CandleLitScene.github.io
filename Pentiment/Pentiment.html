    <p class="spoiler">This page is intended for people who have completed <em><a class="link" href="https://pentiment.obsidian.net/" target="_blank"><em>Pentiment</em></a></em>. If you haven't, I suggest playing/finishing the game first before procedding—it is wonderful!</p>

    <br> 
    <p class="spoiler">My goal for this page is to compile notes on various aspects of <em>Pentiment</em>: I make no claims that any of the information found below is exclusive to this website, nor do I have any pretensions that it is somehow more completely or neatly presented here. Rather, I simply want to collect—and possibly share, if anyone else besides myself ever reads these words—in one place which is convenient for me some information about one of my favorite games.</p>

        <p><strong>Pentiment</strong> [pentimento; It.: ‘repentance’]</p>
        <p>"Visible evidence of an alteration to a painting or drawing that suggests a change of mind on the part of the artist. In particular, it refers to previous workings revealed by the change in the refractive index of oil paint that occurs as it ages."
        <br>

        <p>The relationship between the title and the narrative of the game is at once glaringly obvious and, the longer one thinks about it, wonderfully subtle and multi-faceted: a delightful <a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pentiment/comments/zc6y35/the_title/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> thread from the <em>Pentiment</em> subreddit outlines several of these connections. One of the most lovely is the town of Tassing itself—as a Christian town built over the ruins of a Roman town build over the ruins of a Pagan town, it is itself a vast piece of interconnected architectual pentimenti.<sup>[<a class="link" href="Pentiment.html#foot3">3</a>]</sup></p>

        <p>While the term "pentiment" is usually applied to paintings, the opening of the game seems to suggest a literary analog—the players first action in the game is to erase the text of a manuscript with a pumice stone, beginning the creation process of a <em>palimpsest</em>, or a manuscript that was erased and written on again. This was in fact a common practice in Scriptoriums, where partchment was not as readily available as texts to copy.<sup>[<a class="link" href="Pentiment.html#foot4">4</a>]</sup></p>

        <img class="gif" src="PentImg/Pentimento.gif" alt="Pentimento" />
        <figcaption>
            The Latin text the player erases is a translated selection from Umberto Eco's <em>The Name of the Rose</em>, which can be <a class="link" href="Pentiment.html#Rose">found</a> in the game's bibliography. Anyone familiar with the plot of Eco's novel will see the aptness of this reference.

    <h1 id="bib">The Bibliography</h1>
    
    <p>One of the most unique features of <em>Pentiment</em> is the lengthy bibliography which greets the player directly after the credits. This list is available on other websites, such as Reddit and Tumblr; I am recreating it here verbatim, mostly for my own quick reference, and with the edition of some notes and links. By nature these links are tenous, so please email me if one gets taken down or privated!</p>
