    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

    <p>
        Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) was a German painter, draughtsman, printmaker and writer. Born in Nuremberg and originally trained as a goldsmith, Dürer would become one of the greatest artists of the German Renaissance, widely respected and admired by both his contemporaries and modern art historians. Dürer traveled throughout his life, meeting other artists and craftsmen from across Europe.

        This page contains two of his writings, each of which includes images and togglable clarifying annotations created by me. Both of these works are also available (sans my annotations) online via Project Gutenberg, but I find reading longer texts on their site nonideal and so have decided to host the works here as well.<sup>[<a class="link" href="durer.html#foot1">1</a>]</sup>

    <p>
        <em><a class="link" href="/Durer/Journeys.html">Records of Journeys to Venice and the Low Countries</a></em> compiles a set of letters Dürer sent to his humanist friend Willibald Pirckheimer during his second trip to Italy from 1505-7 with a diary kept during his trip to the Netherlands from 1520-1.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em><a class="link" href="/Durer/letters.html">Of the Just Shaping of Letters</a></em> is a short treatise on the construction of letters by means of geometric shapes and measurements. It is an excerpt from a longer work of geometric theory for the artist: <a class="link" href="https://archive.org/details/vnderweysungderm00drer/page/n113/mode/2up" target="_blank"><em>Vnderweisung der Messung, mit dem Zirkel vnd Richtscheyt</em></a>, published in Nuremberg in 1525; the entire work, as far as I can tell, has never been translated into English.

            The sidenotes used on both pages are adapted from Unobtrusive Sidenotes v1.2 copyright arc90. The original webpage for these sidenotes is no longer online, but I was able to find a copy of the .js file on the Wayback Machine and piece together the appropriate CSS styling from resources on the Wayback Machine and the stylesheets of extant websites that use Unobtrusive Sidenotes. If you are interested in the project and looking for the files, feel free to email me.
