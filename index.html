        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hello! This is Owen, though I tend to set my username on any given website as some variation of "Candle-Lit
            Scene", hence the title of this website.</p>
        <p>A personal website like this may seem like screaming into the void, typing away to never be found or read by
            anyone. In all honesty, I don't really care! The internet—with its abundance of AI slop, SEO optimization,
            and "everything apps"—seems to be essentially dead, anyhow. I view this website not so much as a shout into
            nothingness, but instead as a bacterium happily snacking on the carcass of a whale slowly rotting at the
            bottom of the ocean. I can put things here that I find interesting and possibly share them with people I
            know. I am also someone who fundamentally likes tinkering, so learning how to create this website from
            scratch (and banging my head against the wall to get JS and CSS to work) has been reward enough for me. If
            you somehow stumble upon this page without me having sent it to you: welcome!</p>

        <br>
        <p>Here is an outline of what can be found on my site:</p>

                        Companion</a></h3>

                <p class="index">A reproduction of David Cliffe's defunct <em>Brideshead Revisited</em> annotations, to which I
                    have added several dozen new reference photographs and a handful of new entries.</p>
