    <p id="cap1"><em>“History is that certainty produced at the point where the imperfections of memory meet the inadequacies of documentation.”</em><sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot1">1</a>]</sup></p>
    
    <p>So begins this beguilingly slim volume which, through word-of-mouth in the intellectual ferment of post-war Paris, became a classic of French historiography almost immediately after the author's untimely death in 1953. Yet despite its fame within France, as well as a brief moment of notoriety—mostly confirmed to university campuses—in the United States and Great Britain
        following a hastily executed 1954 translation, this remarkable work still remains largely
        unknown outside of its country of origin. With this new translation, meticulously researched and
        tenderly rendered by Julien Anglais-Écurie, LaGrange's masterwork—his only published work—
        can now be experienced by the English-speaking reader in all its strange power.</p>

    <p id="cap2">It has perhaps always been the narratives surrounding <em>Le sentiment d'un début</em> and its
        author which have attracted the most attention outside of (and even in) France: the infamy and
        rage, their tragic outcome, and the enduring mystery of the man and his work are indeed of a
        caliber seldom found in such placid topics as historiography, even in the histrionic atmosphere of
        French intellectual life. When Michel Foucault famously described <em>L'affaire LaGrange</em>, as the
        entire controversy was to become known, as "that densest of onions, whose core is madness,"<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot2">2</a>]</sup> it
        was unclear if he was referring to LaGrange himself, his book, or both together. Yet behind the
        purely sensational aspects of LaGrange's life sit ideas of genuine merit to the philosophy of
        history. It is these ideas, which have become obscured by the "unique style," to put it gently, with
        which LaGrange expressed them, that Anglais-Écurie herein attempts to elucidate.</p>

        <p>To this end, this translation is replete with copious notes explaining both the historical/historiographical references made by LaGrange as well as those more unsavory, and
            ultimately deadly, plagiaristic passages. Yet Anglais-Écurie has made the bold—and I think
            prudent—decision to pass no judgement on LaGrange's action in his translation or notes. Those
            lines which so offend academic sensibility will be duly pointed out but, besides where absolutely
            necessary, the reader will be left with only such basic information as the source and, where
            LaGrange translated passages from foreign books into French, the original text as printed in the
            editions he had available to him.</p>

    <p id="cap3">This approach is wholly new to the nascent field of English LaGrange studies, such as it
        is, and is even radical when compared to the several annotated editions of <em>Le sentiment d'un
            début</em> available in French. It will certainly be a shockingly barebones—but hopefully more
        intellectually fulfilling—experience for those English-speaking readers whose only previous
        LaGrange experience comes from the salacious 1954 Schuck translation, a work which sits
        somewhere between academic translation and tabloid sensational. Produced while <em>L'affaire
            LaGrange</em> was still ongoing in Paris, the Schuck translation only identifies around half of the
        purloined lines in the book, to say nothing of its missing several of LaGrange's numerous, and
        important, historical allusions and references; on the whole, it appears more interested in
        describing the scandalous proceedings in France than actually transmitting LaGrange's ideas
        accurately. That this edition—written by <em>une vache espagnole</em>, to use what was reportedly one of
        LaGrange's favorite insults—has been for over thirty years the only English translation of
        LaGrangian thought is a crime against reason thankfully corrected in the present publication.<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot3">3</a>]</sup></p>

        <p>Given the fact that the notes in this volume will avoid such distracting details, it seems
            pertinent to provide here an unadulterated and unvarnished description of LaGrange's life and death for those readers unfamiliar with the basic events. While this biography will be fairly short,
            it will not leave out many of the major details of LaGrange's chronology as we know it today: for
            a death which caused so much writing and discussion, shockingly little is known of the life
            before the publication of that fateful book. Most of the information below is taken from Jacque
            Henri-Abel's <em>LaGrange: Une vie dans les murmures du passé</em> (1963), which is still the most
            comprehensive biography of LaGrange available and draws directly from an unpublished
            memoir-pamphlet LaGrange was working on in the year before his death:</p>

    <p id="cap4">Patrick LaGrange was born Patrick Louis Jean-Luc LaGrange in 1899 in the city of
        Valence, south of Lyon. His father, Édouard Michel LaGrange (185?-1916), was a cemetery
        caretaker who as a young man had had his right hand blown off during the Franco-Prussian War,
        an experience which left Édouard embittered with and suspicious of all political activity; his one
        strong political stance was a vehement, almost fanatical anti-war sentiment.<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot4">4</a>]</sup> The lessons in
        political cynicism transmitted from the pessimistic Édouard to young Patrick were to have an
        outsized effect on LaGrange's early thinking, if for no other reason than through a total lack of
        familial political engagement; LaGrange was later to say that it wasn't until he was in the army in
        his early teens that he heard adults speak of matters other than "food, family, and finances."<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot5">5</a>]</sup> His
        mother, Marie-Coralie Archambeau (1879-1899), died in childbirth, leaving the young LaGrange
        and his father more-or-less alone; Édouard had four children from a previous marriage, three of
        whom still lived in Valence, but Patrick was Édouard's last child and, by that time, the only one
        still living at home. They lived quietly in a small but well-made cottage on the outer grounds of
        the <em>Cathédrale Saint-Apollinaire de Valence</em> where Édouard worked. LaGrange would go on to
        remember the house as physically comfortable but intellectually unstimulating for a precocious
        child such as himself, calling it "a place without books."<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot6">6</a>]</sup></p>

    <p>Indeed, it was this lack of stimulation that led LaGrange, at the tender age of fifteen, to leave Valence unannounced in the middle of a warm August night and bike almost sixty-five
        miles, over the course of two days, to Lyon to enlist in the French Army. Placed into the Fifth
        Army under General Louis Franchet d'Espèrey, LaGrange, through a series of clerical mistakes,
        was immediately given a spot on a troop convoy moving towards the front and, without receiving
        any sort of military training, was thrust into combat in the autumn of 1914. It is through such
        confounding circumstances that LaGrange found himself holding a rifle for the first time in his
        life, participating in the <em>miracle de la Marne</em> and pursuing German troops toward the Aisne
        River; it is also, even more confoundingly, in the bloody fields of northeastern France that
        LaGrange the historian was born.</p>

    <p id="cap5">On the morning of September 10th, LaGrange received a letter from his father for the first
        time since his midnight decampment several weeks prior; he had written Édouard a short note
        while waiting with the troop convoy in Paris and fully expected his father, despite his general
        anti-war feelings, to praise his youngest son for valiantly seeking to serve his country. Instead,
        Édouard, writing uneasily with his remaining, non-dominant hand, told his son that it was clear
        he had not listened to a word of advice his father had ever given him and that he would do well
        to not return to Valence if he somehow survived the war; whether or not he continued living—
        and Édouard opined he would not—he was dead to his father. "Despite cleaning the blood off my
        boots with dirty water the night before," LaGrange would later say of his reaction to the letter, "it
        was not until I read those words that my childhood truly died."<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot7">7</a>]</sup> Abandoned by his only close
        family, the devastated LaGrange wandered to the outskirts of the camp and, looking out over the
        Aisne, had his leg grazed by a sniper's bullet. The horrific casualties suffered by the Fifth Army
        during the Battle of the Marne meant that staffing for officers was constantly being depleted and
        LaGrange, whose mostly superficial wound merely limited his mobility, was forced to spend
        most of his recovery working in the tent of one Sergeant Maurice Cointreau; it was in Cointreau
        that LaGrange was to find a surrogate father and first mentor.</p>

    <p id="cap6">Cointreau, like many French officers, was a man of middle-age and high social standing; born into a moderately wealthy merchant family, he was, by the outset of the war, a well-
        respected history professor at the Sorbonne. What's more, he was known for being absolutely
        devoted to his chosen subject, and to that end he had brought a selection of his vast library with
        him to the front, intent on letting the war affect his research as little as possible. Even just in
        seeing him negotiating the clerical duties of an officer's tent—taking dictations, reading
        telegrams, pouring champagne—Cointreau was able to sense the deep, untapped intelligence in
        LaGrange, an intelligence that in Valence had always pushed up against the surface but had yet to
        break through. Perhaps his aim was to regain some of the academic atmosphere he so dearly
        missed during his separation from his beloved Sorbonne, or maybe he was just looking to escape,
        however briefly, the Hellish vistas of human suffering encountered daily outside the flaps of the
        tent: whatever the reason, Cointreau decided to take the young LaGrange as a pupil. LaGrange,
        in turn, proved to be more adept than Cointreau initially expected: LaGrange remembered how,
        "the first time I asked 'but how do the common people fit into all this?', bombs exploding outside
        and shaking the canvas of the tent, a strange look came over Mr. Cointreau's eyes, followed by a
        mad flash of joy."<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot8">8</a>]</sup> Eventually, after LaGrange's injury healed, Cointreau was to go as far as
        transferring the young man permanently to his staff for the sole purpose of continuing their
        lessons and discussions, a position LaGrange kept for the remainder of his time in the war.</p>

        <p id="cap7">It was through such improbable events that LaGrange ended up spending many of his
            nights as a solider studying to the sound of shellfire and dogfighting. Cointreau and he read
            through and discussed many major works in French history and historiography, from the classics
            of the late 19th century—such as Jules Michelet's <a class="link" href="https://archive.org/details/historyfrancetr00michgoog/page/n6/mode/2up" target="_blank"><em>Historie de France</em></a> and Hippolyte Taine's <a class="link" href="https://archive.org/details/lesoriginesdela12taingoog/mode/2up" target="_blank"><em>Les
                Origens de la France Contemporaine</em></a>—to more contemporary works, such as François Alphonse
            Aulard's recently published <a class="link" href="https://archive.org/details/tudesetleons09aulauoft/mode/2up" target="_blank"><em>Études et leçons sur la Révolution française</em></a>. Cointreau, despite his
            wealthy background and officership, was also interested in more radical historical work, as well
            as the burgeoning idea of "history from below"<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot9">9</a>]</sup>, and he had with him on the front such provocative titles as the recently assassinated socialist Jean Juarès' <a class="link" href="https://archive.org/details/histoiresocialis09jauruoft" target="_blank"><em>Histoire Socialiste</em></a>, then
            barely a decade old.</p>

    <p id="cap8">These books, and the accompanying discussions with Cointreau, were to become the
        seeds of LaGrangian thought; even where LaGrange's views diverge from the turn-of-the-century
        works he studied with Cointreau, as they often do, these texts can always be located as the
        starting point, the beginning of the theoretical discussion. So too can the violence—the abject
        horror of death, decay, and confusion—in which these initial forays into historical thought took
        place: "Take my work to be a house: the parapets were carved in university by Bloch and
        Febvre," LaGrange would say in a 1950 letter to his publisher, "while the foundation was laid by
        Cointreau in Hell."<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot10">10</a>]</sup></p>

    <p id="cap9">In May of 1917 the Fifth Army, including Cointreau and LaGrange, again found
        themselves on the Aisne River, just west of the commune of Lœuilly, taking part in the Second
        Battle of the Aisne. On the night of May 5th, an hour after sundown, Cointreau and LaGrange
        were discussing Voltaire's <a class="link" href="https://archive.org/details/sicledelouisxiv00voltgoog" target="_blank"><em>Le Siècle de Louis XIV</em></a>. Cointreau got up to retrieve a book from his
        desk and was walking with it along the wall of the tent when a shell exploded outside, mere feet
        from where he was standing; he was obliterated instantly. LaGrange, sitting several meters away,
        received burns on a significant portion of his body, a large piece of shrapnel in his right thigh
        (which caused him to walk with a limp for the rest of his life), and a concussion from the remains
        of Cointreau striking him in the head. "One second [Cointreau] was walking and moving his
        hands emphatically to make some point, and the next he was splashed upon my face and body,
        the pages of his book sticking to my skin."<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot11">11</a>]</sup> This injury was effectively the end of the war for
        LaGrange: he spent the remainder of 1917 recovering in a military hospital and returned to
        Valence in the spring of 1918 to find an empty house and his father's grave in the cemetery he
        had cared for his entire adult life.</p>

        <p id="cap10">The injury, and Cointreau's death, also mark the end of reliable autobiographical information about LaGrange; the aforementioned memoir-pamphlet, which LaGrange appears to
            have worked on intermittently throughout 1952, ends abruptly upon his return to Valence.
            Whether LaGrange had already stopped working on the pamphlet when <em>L'affaire LaGrange</em>
            broke out or ceased writing because of the stress the scandal caused him is unknown.
            Unfortunately, the end result is that, after the war, LaGrange disappears back into <em>des masses</em> he
            would later so emphasize in his writing.<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot12">12</a>]</sup> We know only the most basic facts about his life
            between the end of the time outlined in his pamphlet and the publication on <em>Le sentiment d'un
                début</em>: he tried to enroll at the Sorbonne but, without proof of his connection to Cointreau and no
            other form of education, he was not accepted and instead studied at the <em>Université Grenoble
                Alpes</em>, then a very small and isolated school. After graduating as a middling student he returned
            to Lyon and became an instructor of history at the public <em>Lycée du Parc</em>, where he taught from
            1921 to 1939, all the while learning several foreign languages (he would eventually be proficient
            in English, Spanish, and German, as well as being comfortable reading Italian, Russian, and
            Hebrew) and writing prolifically about history and historiography in his free time. Sadly, almost
            no manuscripts survive for these works, as LaGrange burned most of his papers as his mental
            state deteriorated in July of 1953. LaGrange also kept an obsessive eye on the work of the
            <em>Annales</em> school, subscribing to their titular journal and reading almost every word published by
            the members of its first generation, such a Bloch, Hauser, and Febvre. LaGrange, viewing
            himself as an unknown but important member of the <em>Annales</em> school, submitted several essays to
            the journal for publication, though none were ever accepted.<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot13">13</a>]</sup> We know almost nothing of what
            LaGrange did during Nazi occupation: he quit his job in 1939 and virtually disappears until the
            publication of <em>Le sentiment d'un début</em> in 1952. By 1949 we know he was living alone in a small
            apartment on Île Saint-Louis, but his source of income and daily activities remain a complete
            mystery.</p>

    <p id="cap11">And then, as abruptly as he left, LaGrange reappears into history: on November 25th, 1952, a small, unknown French publishing house—<em>Éditions Scudéry</em>—released a short work by an equally unknown French historian. It went unreviewed and unmentioned for almost two
        months until, in January of 1953, someone loaned a copy to Jean-Paul Sartre, Paris' intellectual
        tastemaker par excellence, which he reads, in his own words, "twice a day for a week."<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot14">14</a>]</sup> On
        February 2nd, a review is published by Sartre in <em>Les Temps modernes</em>, his own journal, in which
        <em>Le sentiment d'un début</em> is called "the most important book for historiography since Carlyle"<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot15">15</a>]</sup>;
        by the end of that week <em>Éditions Scudéry</em> cannot print copies fast enough to meet demand. Paris
        in the early spring of 1953 is gripped by one central question: Who is Patrick LaGrange? Sartre's
        review ends with a plea to the author: "Reveal yourself, our modern Herodotus, and all Paris
        shall be lain before your feet."<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot16">16</a>]</sup></p>

        <p id="cap12">By the end of February, Paris has its answer: on the 28th, LaGrange walks into the office
            of <em>Éditions Julliard</em>, the publisher of <em>Les Temps modernes</em>, and makes his identity known. Soon
            he is smoking in cafes with Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and their cohort, and eating dinner with
            history professors from the Sorbonne. In the chic intellectual scene of post-war Paris, LaGrange
            stood out; as de Beauvoir would later tell Henri-Abel, "his hair was long and matted, his
            fingernails uncut. He spoke with a heavy country accent and seemed to come almost to the point
            of tears if someone disagreed with him."<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot17">17</a>]</sup> LaGrange, for his part, seems to have viewed his
            sudden fame as both a gift and a natural outcome of his work, something which was always due
            to find him eventually. Being interviewed on a radio program in April, LaGrange described his
            sudden contact with the full range of French intellectual culture: "I get kind letters from Camus,
            angry letters from Merleau-Ponty, and incomprehensible letters from Lacan. I try to answer all of
            them as promptly as possible."<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot18">18</a>]</sup></p>

        <p id="cap13">Yet, despite LaGrange's seemingly easy assumption of the role of French historian <em>du
            jour</em>, all was not well with the "modern Herodotus." When Sartre suggested to LaGrange that he
            start working on a new edition of <em>Le sentiment d'un début</em> to be published by <em>Éditions Julliard</em> in larger printings—and that he give Sartre copies of the original manuscript so Sartre could write
            his own introduction and help compile more thorough notes—LaGrange reacted with
            uncharacteristic anger. Then, on June 13th, a strange comment appeared in <em>Les Temps modernes</em>:
            a French academic, working on translations of Henry James' short stories, had noticed a line in
            the book which appeared to be an almost direct quotation from the story <a class="link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1093" target="_blank"><em>The Beast in the Jungle</em></a>. In
            the second chapter, § 3 (p. 49 of this edition), the line "history affects us as the sequel of
            something to which we have lost the beginning"—« l'histoire nous affecte comme la suite de
            quelques chose dont nous avons perdu le commencement »—bears striking resemblance to
            James' "It affected him as the sequel of something of which he had lost the beginning."<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot19">19</a>]</sup> The
            academic does not think there is anything wrong with the allusion to James, in fact he praises
            LaGrange for appropriating the quote in such a thematically fitting way, but he kindly suggests
            that in future editions James be mentioned and that perhaps that instead of LaGrange's own
            translation, which appears to be the source, his own is used instead.</p>

        <p>In the next edition of <em>Les Temps modernes</em>, three more comments were received: a
            Dostoyevsky scholar had also noticed an unsourced quotation, this time from <a class="link" href="https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/8117" target="_blank"><em>The Possessed</em></a> (see
            p. 23 & fn. 51), a fellow historian a line lifted from Alexis de Tocqueville's <a class="link" href="https://archive.org/details/DeLaDmocratieEnAmmrique" target="_blank"><em>De la démocratie en
                Amérique</em></a> (p. 79 & fn. 213), and a musicologist a line that bafflingly seems to have been taken
            from an aria by the 18th century <em>opéra comique</em> composer André Ernest Modeste Grétry (p. 53 &
            fn. 117). All three echo one another in their rationale for not making their discoveries known
            sooner: "I thought it odd but not alarming until it was shown he had done it twice." With these
            innocuous words, the floodgates were opened. By the next week <em>Les Temps modernes</em>—and most
            other prominent Parisian publications—were being sent dozens of claims of plagiarism a day.
            The list of texts LaGrange pulled from is dizzying in its scope: a vast array of French, German,
            English, Spanish, and Russian novels (see fn. 2 for an extended note on the novels in LaGrange's
            personal library); a propagandistic biography of Pierre Laval published by the <em>Régime de Vichy</em>
            (p. 111 & fn. 234); and the <a class="link" href="https://anthologydev.lib.virginia.edu/work/Julian/julian-revelation" target="_blank">mystical devotions</a> of 14th century English anchoress Julian of
            Norwich (p. 12 & fn. 22), to identify a few of the writer's favorites.</p>

        <p id="cap13">It did not take long for <em>L'affaire LaGrange</em> to be the headline of most Parisian newspapers. On an afternoon in late June, Sartre sat down with his copy of <em>Le sentiment d'un
            début</em> and a pen and underlined every credible accusation of plagiarism thus far received. "As the
            pages blackened with ink, so too did Jean-Paul's face." de Beauvoir would later write, "He spat
            on the ground and stormed off, mumbling under his breath."<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot20">20</a>]</sup> For Sartre, the very honor and
            credibility of <em>Les Temps modernes</em>—and his own name—had been sullied by a man he would
            only thereafter call "that damned fool LaGrange."<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot21">21</a>]</sup> By this time, LaGrange was no longer
            leaving his apartment, answering calls, or responding to letters, from Sartre or otherwise. When
            he did break his silence, LaGrange, a life-long lover of classical music, replied with a now
            infamous comment in a <em>France-Soir</em> column: "Do you object to Brahms containing Bach?"<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot22">22</a>]</sup></p>

        <p>After an additional agonizing month, in which LaGrange burned most of his papers and
            had all his food and wine delivered to his door by his landlady, he once again slipped out into the
            indifferent embrace of a warm August night. This time, instead of biking away to protect the
            future of France, LaGrange quietly accepted what he felt had irrevocably become the end of his
            own. In the early morning hours of August 15th, 1953, Patrick LaGrange slipped softly into the
            Seine, his jacket pockets full of stones and trinkets from the first World War.</p>

    <p>Sartre privately expressed hope that the shocking death would quell the controversy but,
        much to his consternation, LaGrange's suicide had the exact opposite effect. By the time his body
        was dredged from the bottom of the river the following evening, the fate of the disgraced
        historian was the sole topic of conversation in Paris. With LaGrange gone, the discussion around
        <em>L'affaire LaGrange</em> turned on all sides more extreme: the majority, who saw the deceased as a
        fraud and a disgrace to French scholarship, grew more vitriolic in their attacks on his honor,
        character, and life (that little of it that was known, at least). His activities during the war—or
        rather, the lack of information about what exactly those activities were— drew immediate
        suspicion, and the invocation of that most dreaded of epithets: <em>collaborateur</em>. On the other hand, there was a minority of French intellectuals—notably historian Albert Mathiez—who defended
        LaGrange and his work, arguing that the use of unsourced quotations and unclear allusions was
        in fact exactly the point of <em>Le sentiment d'un début</em>, an active demonstration of the meeting of
        "memory and documentation" the book spends so much time describing. In the hysterical attitude
        immediately after LaGrange's death these defenders lifted him up to an almost deistic level: the
        tragic, mad genius of French history who saw what we could not and told us in language to
        complex for us to understand, only to be killed by the ignorant masses by vicious assaults on his
        sensitive nature.</p>

    <p id="cap14">There was also, beyond the philosophizing and debating, more practical matters to be
        settled: how should the money made by the book's sales—which, due to the controversy, were
        only going up over time—be allocated. Did any of the multitudinous people plagiarized by
        LaGrange deserve compensation? Normally, a case of plagiarization does not call for a
        reassessment of the intellectual property rights of a text. Normally. Court officials at the time
        estimated that up to half of the book’s contents were either direct quotations or clear paraphrases
        to other works.<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot23">23</a>]</sup> As soon as word spread that there might be money involved in being quoted by
        LaGrange, the amount of people reporting the theft of their own work increased by an order of
        magnitude. LaGrange's grocer claimed that he and LaGrange had had many long, involved
        discussions about the nature of history while LaGrange paid for his vegetables, discussions
        which LaGrange supposedly copied verbatim as large passages of his book. What began as a
        scandal about the philosophy of history was now threatening to challenge the most basic tenets
        of French copyright law. It is beyond the scope of this preface to address the legal arguments
        made about, and eventual ramifications of, <em>L'affaire LaGrange</em> in the French courts:<sup>[<a class="link" href="Debut.html#foot24">24</a>]</sup> suffice to
        say that it is one of the cruel tragedies of life that the name LaGrange is as known today more by
        students of French <em>droit d'auteur</em> law than it is to students of historiography.</p>

    <p>And so, as LaGrange tells us in the opening lines of chapter 4, "history dances on to a
        rhythm only it can hear;" by the mid-1950s, Paris at large had moved on. The legal battles were over, as was the initial excitement shown by intellectuals and academics. There were new books,
        new ideas, and new scandals to focus on, and the name Patrick LaGrange was slowly relegated to
        certain history courses at the Sorbonne, or the odd mention in an article by a non-French
        historiographer. Yet there is something enduring about LaGrange’s work, something besides the
        almost unbelievable details of his life and death. He had a prescience—some kind of clouded
        foresight—into the current information age in which we all live; an age beyond the
        metanarrative, beyond the comforting idea that there is trail which we can follow through the
        ruins of time to be illuminated about our past and ourselves. He could see a coming time when
        the yarn of truth, the very fabric from which history is weaved each day before our eyes, would
        be bifurcated countless times into a million little individual threads. Regardless of how the
        plagiarization in <em>Le sentiment d'un début</em> makes one feels about LaGrange as a scholar, it must
        strike true with some chord in the soul listening to LaGrange as a communicator of the <em>feeling</em> of
        being alive in the (post)modern world. The basic fact is that LaGrange's method of presentation
        was ultimately the one taken up by all the world, despite the objections to him in his time; to be
        alive today is to turn on the television, tune into the radio, or read the newspaper and find a
        LaGrangian presentation of both history and our present moment—as a jumbled, polyvocal wall
        of fragments taken from here and there, assembled intricately and yet incomprehensibly. It is all
        we can do to try to get <em>Le sentiment d'un début</em>.</p>

        [<a class="link" href="Debut.html#cap2">2</a>]  « Cette plus dense d'oignons, dont le trognon est la folie » (Foucault, <em>Les Temps modernes</em>, July 23rd, 1972) It was
        a bastardized version of this quote, recklessly shortened to just "The maddest of onions!", which ungracefully graced
        the cover of the 1954 Schuck translation and inspired much mockery of French academia on American university
        campuses.
        </p>

        <p id="foot3">
        [<a class="link" href="Debut.html#cap3">3</a>] If the only purpose of this new translation was to correct the many mistakes and omissions of the aforementioned
        horrendous translation than it would be performing a noble task. In fact, there have also been several <em>new</em>
        discoveries in LaGrange's notes and papers—which weren't accessible to researchers until the entire <em>L'affaire
            LaGrange</em> was wrapped up in the early 1970s—which shine new light on, and at times challenge, some of the most
        basic tenets LaGrangian historiography. Take, for example, that most famous line, quoted at the start of this preface,
        which has come to serve as a slogan of LaGrange's work in general. It was discovered that, for the first several drafts
        of the work, LaGrange instead had « L'histoire est cette certitude produite au point où les imperfections de la
        mémoire <em><strong>affrontent</strong></em> les insuffisances de la documentation. » —"the point where the imperfections of memory
        <em><strong>confront</strong></em> the inadequacies of documentation." Such scholarly information will also be included in Anglais-Écurie's
        notes.

        <p id="foot4">
        [<a class="link" href="Debut.html#cap4">4</a>] Édouard perhaps had other, more historical, reasons to be suspicious of political engagement: the Valence
        LaGrange's could trace their family line back to the disgraced fortune teller Magdelaine de La Grange (1641-1679),
        who was arrested in 1677 and later executed as part of the <em>affaire des poisons</em>, a poisoning and witchcraft scandal
        that ultimately left thirty-six people dead, several from the inner circle of Louis XIV.

        que mon enfance est vraiment morte. » (ibid., 22) Édouard's letter turned out to be ironically prophetic: death would
        indeed mean that father and son would never reunite, though it would be his own, not Patrick's; Édouard died of
        inflammation of the stomach a little over a year before LaGrange would leave the army and return to Valence again.

        [<a class="link" href="Debut.html#cap7">9</a>] A phrase which comes from French historian Georges Lefebvre: « <em>histoire vue d'en bas et non d'en haut</em> » Lefebvre
        used the phrase in a 1932 review of a work by Albert Mathiez, a prominent member of the <em>Annales</em> school with
        which LaGrange would later identify.

        <p id="foot12">
        [<a class="link" href="Debut.html#cap10">12</a>] There is perhaps no greater cliche in LaGrangian scholarship than pointing out that, yes, the life of the man
        matches his most famous claim about the nature of history—yet, despite the triteness of this observation, it is so
        remarkable that it does bear repeating, even if the author does so with some embarrassment.
