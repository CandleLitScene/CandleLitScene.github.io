        <p><em>I meet Sebastian Flyte - and Anthony Blanche - I visit Brideshead for the first time</em></p>

        <p><strong>23 (21) Et in Arcadia ego</strong><br />
            ‘I too am in Arcadia’ (Latin). Arcadia was celebrated in ancient times (by the Roman poet Virgil, among
            others) as a rural paradise where one could find innocence and true understanding. This meaning persisted
            throughout western civilisation until modern times. The original Arcadia was a central area of the
            Peloponnese in Greece. It is actually a mountainous and dangerous region but a people who exhibited
            generosity, simplicity and contentedness supposedly inhabited it in ancient times.</p>

        <p>The point of the motto <em>Et in Arcadia ego</em> is that Death is speaking it. Even in the happiest times,
            Death is saying, decay and disaster are not far away. It seems that the phrase dates back to the early
            Renaissance (the fifteenth century) as it has not been traced any earlier; but it had a lively existence in
            many paintings and writings of that period.</p>

        <p><span id="cap1"></span>Perhaps the motto’s most celebrated appearance is in a painting of 1655 by Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665), where
        various puzzled Arcadian characters are tracing the barely-visible words on a tomb.</p>

                Poussin's Arcadia (and the Death that lurks within) one can explore Thomas Adès <a class="link"
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxNVxMewU9M" target="_blank"><em>Arcadiana</em></a>—the 4th
                mvt. of which, "Et... (tango mortale)", is directly inspired by Poussin's painting— and Lou Harrison's
                <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGFz76EJyM0" target="_blank">"Chorale: Et in
                    Arcadio Ego"</a>, the 2nd mvt. from the <em>Suite for Symphonic Strings</em>. Harrison beautifully
                captures the elegaic mood of Poussin's second painting, and the piece also fits very well with the, if
                not elegaic, at least wistful tone of Charles' reflections on his early experiences at Oxford and
                Brideshead. Incidentally, the 1805 novel </em>Ein Jahr in Arkadien: Kyllenion (A Year in Arcadia:
            Kyllenion)<em>—by Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg—is the earliest known novel that centers on an
                explicitly male-male love affair; I have seen no evidence Waugh was aware of the work.</em>]</p>

        <p><strong>21 fool’s-parsley</strong> [<em>Only in Am. Ed.</em>]<br />
            A poisonous plant with white flowers whose unpleasant smell no one could mistake for real parsley. </p>

        <p><strong>23 (21) meadowsweet</strong> <br />
            In England, a tall odoriferous plant of the rose family with white flowers. It likes to grow on damp soils,
            and so in meadows and ditches.</p>

        <p><strong>23 (21) Eights Week</strong> <br />
            A period of five days in the fifth week of Oxford University’s Trinity (summer) term, usually in early June,
            devoted to rowing and social events. Not only young women but parents, graduates and distinguished guests
            like to attend. Some of them are interested in rowing.</p>

        <p><strong>23 (21) Lyonnesse</strong> <br />
            A legendary country which in Arthurian times connected Cornwall with the Scilly Isles and later was
            overwhelmed by the sea. (The date of this inundation is amazingly precise in some accounts : it happened on
            11th November 1099. One man alone survived.)</p>

        <p>Lyonnesse was the native land of the hero Tristram. Some people who consider themselves authorities in the
            matter postulate that it is the real Atlantis.</p>

        <p><strong>23 (21) aquatint</strong><span id="cap4"></span><br />
            A picture produced by etching a copper plate in a sophisticated system of acid applications of varying
            lengths of time, each one biting more deeply into the unprotected areas of the ground, which are varied on
            each repetition (generally reduced) to give the required effect. The result is areas of varied tints similar
            to a watercolour wash. EW is emphasising the subdued but beautiful shades and tints of Oxford at that time.

        <p><strong>23 (21) Newman’s day</strong> <br />
            The Venerable (Cardinal) John Henry Newman (1801-1890) was the most prominent scholar and clergyman in
            Oxford until his conversion to the Roman Catholic Church in 1845. Since at that time the University was open
            only to members of the Church of England, he had to leave Oxford. His day was therefore the 1830’s and early
            1840’s.</p>

        <p><strong>23 (21) gables</strong><span id="cap5"></span><br />
            The broadly triangular extension to the top of the wall of a building formed by sloping roofs is called the
            gable or gable-end. Its shape and decoration can give great aesthetic pleasure.</p>

        <p><strong>23 the soft airs of centuries of youth<br />
                21 the soft vapours of a thousand years of learning</strong> <br />
            In the first edition of BR, EW wrote <em>the soft vapours of a thousand years of learning</em>. He later
            revised this to <em>the soft airs of centuries of youth</em>. He had been criticised for making Oxford
            University older than it was. He might have been amused to learn that recent research has shown that
            considerable learning was undertaken at Oxford in the eleventh century, long before the charter which
            recognised the university’s status in 1214. In any case, University College claims to have been founded by
            Alfred the Great (849-899, king from 871)! <br />

        <p><strong>23 (21) cloistral hush</strong><span id="cap7"></span><br />
            Cloisters were the covered walkways built by monks around an open courtyard adjoining a church or monastery.
            EW’s phrase reminds readers that the ancient universities were church foundations and that these
            ecclesiastical origins persist in the architecture of Oxford.</p>

        <p><strong>23 (21) claret cup</strong> <br />
            an iced summer drink made principally from claret, brandy, citrus, and sugar. A typical recipe of the time
            was : <br />
            1 quart Bordeaux wine, 2 tablespoons brandy, half a cup of Curaçao, sugar to taste, 1 quart mineral water,
            mint leaves, a third of a cup of orange (or orange and lemon) juice, cucumber rind, 12 strawberries. Mix all
            the ingredients except the mineral water, using enough sugar to sweeten to taste. Stand on ice to chill, and
            add the chilled mineral water just before serving. </p>
        <p>The original idea was to hand the cup round <em>with a clean napkin passed through one of the handles, that
                the edge of the cup may be wiped after each guest has partaken of the contents thereof</em>. (Mrs
            Beeton) </p>

        <p><strong>23 (21) punts</strong><span id="cap8"></span><br />
            A punt is a long, narrow, flat-bottomed boat with squared ends which is propelled along a river by a man
            wielding a long pole which he thrusts against the river bed. The operation requires some skill if it is to
            appear sufficiently elegant. It is characteristic of Oxford and Cambridge life in summer to while time away
            in such a manner. <br />

        <p><strong>23 (21) college barges</strong><span id="cap9"></span><br />
            Many Oxford colleges had their own moored barges from which to view the events on the river. Often they were
            beautifully decorated. Sadly, they have nearly all departed; their place has been taken by college
            boathouses on the river banks. Existing barges are often to be found elsewhere on the river, attached to
            hotels, for example.</p>

        <p id="Isis"><strong>23 (21) <em>Isis</em></strong> <br />
            Founded in 1892, one of two long-lasting Oxford undergraduate magazines and here, presumably, of the
            offices. The other is called <em>Cherwell</em> (pronounced at that time, and often today too, as
            <em>Charwell</em>). EW wrote and illustrated for both, and for a short-lived magazine called <em>The Oxford
                Broom</em> founded by his friend Harold Acton. When he wrote for <em>Isis</em>, EW at first adopted the
            <em>nom de plume</em> of Scaramel.
        </p>

        <p>The river Thames at Oxford is known as the Isis. Oxford is built on the neck of land formed by the Isis and a
            tributary of it called the Cherwell.</p>

        <p><strong>23 (21) Union</strong> <br />
            The Oxford Union, founded in 1823, is the premier forum for debating issues, great and small, in the
            University. It now attracts the very best speakers in the country and often the world, but in 1923 the
            speakers, with a few exceptions per year, were all students. The Union is also a centre for socialising.</p>

        <p><strong>23 (22) Gilbert-and-Sullivan badinage</strong> <br />
            The operettas of Sir Arthur Sullivan (1842-1900) were and remain extremely popular. His librettist was Sir
            William Schwenck Gilbert (1836-1911); such was the power of his lyrics that, unusually, his name is joined
            with that of the composer. Gilbert’s words are fluent and witty in a manly, Victorian way; they are most
            characteristic, perhaps, when they are cruel and bumptious.</p>

        <p><strong>23 (22) peculiar choral effects in the College chapels</strong> <br />
            EW was notably unmusical except in his writing. It is not clear whether he thinks that all the music in
            chapels is peculiar in intention or effect, or that choirs make a special effort to mock their visitors
            during Eights Week. In any case many colleges had chapels where services were said or sung every day.</p>

        <p><strong>24 (22) don</strong> <br />
            A university lecturer or teacher. The word derives from the Latin word for master, <em>dominus</em>.</p>

        <p><strong>24 (22) Natural Sciences</strong> <br />
            i.e. Science that deals with what is observable in nature (as opposed for example to Mathematics)</p>

        <p><strong>24 (22) oak</strong> <br />
            Generally, students’ rooms in colleges had two doors at their entrance. One was the normal door which opened
            into the room; the other was a thicker door known as the oak which was in the same frame but opened outwards
            into the passageway. The student indicated his desire to be undisturbed by closing this outer door and thus
            <em>sporting his oak</em>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>24 (22) scout</strong> <br />
            A male servant in an Oxford college, generally responsible for the cleaning and maintenance of a group of
            rooms. A relationship bordering on deep friendship sometimes developed between the students and their
            scouts.</p>

        <p><strong>24 (22) Commem.</strong> <br />
            i.e. Commemoration. Commemoration Services and Balls commemorate the foundation of the college and/or its
            founders. They are usually held at the end of the Trinity Term (in the summer) and so can be said also to
            commemorate the departing newly-rewarded graduates. Smaller colleges often have them every year; larger
            colleges, where there might be as many as 2500 guests, hold them biennially or triennially.</p>

        <p><strong>24 (22) Masonic</strong> <br />
            i.e. the Masonic Hall, which organised events like dances but would be out of bounds to students in the
            evening</p>

        <p><strong>24 (22) proctors</strong> <br />
            Discipline inside the colleges was a matter for the colleges themselves. Discipline in the University as a
            whole and especially in the town was the province of the proctors. They were two officials, a Senior Proctor
            and a Junior Proctor, appointed annually by the University to supervise the behaviour of the students. A
            proctor performed the rounds of the town accompanied by assistants nicknamed <em>bulldogs</em> who were
            virtually university policemen and actually called <em>marshalls</em>. The proctors could recommend
            sanctions to the appropriate college authority (or in serious breaches, the University itself) for
            enforcement, but in general themselves imposed fines or a sentence of <em>gating</em> on undergraduate
            defaulters. A student who was gated had to remain in his college after 9.10 p.m. (see my note to Great Tom
            on page 31).</p>

        <p><strong>24 (22) white <em>crêpe de Chine</em></strong> <br />
            A light smooth silk fabric, used to make delicate articles of clothing.</p>

        <p><strong>24 (22) Charvet</strong> <br />
            A haberdasher’s of great distinction founded in 1838, still extant. The shop is in the Place Vendôme in
            Paris.</p>

        <p><strong>24 (22) Château Peyraguey</strong> <br />
            Two châteaux in Sauternes bear this name, Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey and Château Clos Haut-Peyraguey; both
            produce a superb white wine, generally but foolishly considered a dessert wine. Until 1879 the two châteaux
            were one, but then a family quarrel divided them. Clos Haut is sometimes known simply as Château Peyraguey,
            but we know from his <em>Diary</em> that EW drank 1924 Lafaurie-Peyraguey on 19th November 1937 - ‘Delicious
            wine’ he commented. After a period in the twentieth century when the wines produced were relatively
            unimpressive, connoisseurs today generally prefer Lafaurie to Clos Haut, but both retain the <em>premier
                cru</em> classification awarded to the united domain in 1855.</p>

        <p>It is conceivable that Sebastian has brought along a true Château Peyraguey, i.e. one made before the split
            in 1879. (We learn later that there are plenty of old wines at Brideshead that need drinking up - on page 81
            we read that there are vintages that are fifty years old.) It could even be pre-phylloxera wine, since
            French vineyards were slow to combat the invasion of this devastating pest. The Peyraguey that Sebastian and
            Charles drink would have aged nobly and would probably not be past its best.</p>

            Now supposed by dictionaries to be purely a formal term for an automobile in England, it is surprisingly
            hardy. I still hear the phrase quite frequently. Car is certainly much more common.</p>

        <p><strong>25 (23) Morris-Cowley</strong><span id="cap10"></span><br />
            The Morris automobile works were at Cowley near Oxford. They opened in 1912 and by 1923 they were already
            very successful and the district was well into the process of industrialisation that was to end Oxford’s
            reputation for serenity, at least until modern policies of pedestrianisation and exclusion came into force.
        </p>

        <p>The Morris Cowley was produced from 1915 to 1926 especially for the British and Empire markets, which it
            dominated by the mid-1920's. It was distinguished in its appearance by its prominent, rounded radiator,
            which soon inspired the nickname <em>Bullnose</em>. Unlike the Ford Model T with which it competed, the
            Bullnose was at first built out of bought-in components, though as the business grew, these were gradually
            moved in-house or the suppliers were taken over. Its inventor, William Morris, later Lord Nuffield
            (1877-1963), wrested supremacy in the British market from Ford UK by a policy of cutting prices to the
            margins so that by 1925 a Cowley cost only £162.</p>

        <p><strong>25 (23) teddy bear</strong> <br />
            The name <em>teddy bear</em> was invented in late 1902, though Steiff were producing jointed bears a year or
            two earlier in Germany. The toy was named after President Theodore ‘Teddy’ Roosevelt (1858-1919, 26th
            president of the United States 1901-1909), who enjoyed hunting the real article. The nation was enchanted to
            hear that the President had refused to shoot a tied-up and exhausted bear, and two Brooklyn shopkeepers
            Morris and Rose Michtom were spurred on to make the first American teddy bear in his honour. They went on to
            make their fortune with their Ideal Novelty and Toy Company. The bear used in the television series of BR
            was an Ideal bear.</p>

        <p>It is generally considered that EW picked up the idea of having a student carry round a teddy bear from his
            younger friend John Betjeman, the poet (1906-1984), who carried a bear named <em>Archie</em> around with him
            when he was at Oxford, but it seems that many Oxford undergraduates did something similar. Beverly Nichols
            had a toy rabbit named <em>Cuthbert</em> and Keith Douglas (not the poet but a musician and colleague of
            EW’s on the undergraduate magazine <em>Cherwell</em>) displayed a bear in public a little earlier than did
            Betjeman.</p>

            In England this means he was cycling on the right, since all traffic should travel on the left. This
            eccentricity is a survival from a more leisured age when it did not much matter where you cycled. In ALL, EW
            states that even in 1922-3 he doubted that <em>there were thirty cars in the university owned by dons or
                undergraduates</em>.</p>

        <p><strong>25 (23) Carfax</strong><span id="cap12"></span><br />
            A carfax is a central crossing of four roads. The Carfax at Oxford is perhaps the most famous in England. In
            1923 it looked like this.</p>

        <p><strong>25 (23) Well, I did tell him <em>ten</em>.</strong> <br />
            In this light, flippant way we are introduced to Sebastian’s adroit reliance on deception. We are forewarned
            very early.</p>

        <p><strong>25 (24) Swindon</strong> <br />
            A major industrial (and then a railway) town. Here Sebastian turned south into rural Wiltshire.</p>

        <p><strong>26 (24) dry-stone walls</strong> <br />
            Field walls which have been made without mortar. They require considerable skill and occasional maintenance.

        <p><strong>26 (24) ashlar houses</strong> <br />
            Ashlar is now used to describe thin slivers of stone that are used to cover houses with a false facing, the
            intention being to give an effect which is not the original one. Thus one can have a Derbyshire stone
            cottage apparently but incongruously erected in lush rural Kent, if one wishes. In the eighteenth century in
            particular, Wiltshire houses (and houses in many other counties) which originally had walls made of rubble
            were converted into elegant residences by the use of ashlar, often the local limestone. </p>

        <p><strong>26 (24) elms</strong><span id="cap13"></span><br />
            There are now few English elms left in Britain owing to the ravages of Dutch elm disease. Thirty (and
            therefore eighty) years ago elms were an important feature of England’s landscape. Christ Church College had
            a notable elm walk.</p>

            The process in British universities by which a student is admitted. Nowadays it is entirely formal, the
            student already having qualifications, but in the twenties it might have involved an examination.</p>

        <p><strong>26 (24) quadrangle</strong><span id="cap14"></span><br />
            A rectangular court, with a grass garden, formed by having buildings on all four sides. This design is
            characteristic of the older university colleges. The one Ryder lived in is almost certainly the Old Quad in
            Hertford College, which was where EW’s rooms were.</p>

        <p><strong>26 (25) Warden</strong> <br />
            Colleges at Oxford employ various terms for their head. <em>Warden</em> is used by several of them; other
            titles include President, Master, Principal, Dean, Rector and Provost. As EW’s own college, Hertford, has a
            Principal and not a Warden, one assumes at first that Charles Ryder did not go there. Later in the novel (in
            his walk to Sebastian’s rooms in Christ Church) it seems that he did! Consistency to real life in such
            points is perhaps not a vital element in a novel.</p>

        <p><strong>26 (25) Athenaeum</strong> <br />
            A gentlemen’s club in Pall Mall, London. Its members are prominent in the arts, sciences and public service.
            Its membership is select.</p>

        <p><strong>26 (25) Etruscan notions of immortality</strong> <br />
            Mr Ryder is interested in esoteric, not to say obscure, scholarly topics. All that is known of Etruscan
            religion is its use of divination, its belief in gods similar to those of the Romans, its human sacrifice,
            and its belief in a golden age which returns regularly.</p>

        <p><strong>26-7 (25) extension lectures for the working-class</strong> <br />
            The idea of universities running schemes of education for the working-class was already decades old in 1923.
            (Lady Bracknell mentions them with some asperity in Oscar Wilde’s <a class="link"
                href="https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/844" target="_blank"><em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em></a>.)
            Mr Ryder has no intention of talking about them.</p>

        <p><strong>27 (25) but it all comes out of capital, you know</strong> <br />
            One would naturally expect Mr Ryder to say ‘<u>and</u> it all comes’ as if it is a regrettable matter. He
            appears to be implying that Charles is only wasting his own inheritance by agreeing to such a large
            allowance.</p>

        <p><strong>27 (25) Boughton</strong> <br />
            This is the fictional name of the Ryder family seat. The hints given by Mr Ryder and Jasper seem to suggest
            that the Ryders were in origin a fairly well-off landed family with an easy, moneyed, honoured lifestyle.
            Charles is not therefore a poor lad taken up by a rich friend.</p>

        <p><strong>27 (25) a tall hat</strong> <br />
            i.e. a top hat</p>

        <p><strong>27 (25) rowing blue</strong> <br />
            Recognition of the highest status in the sport in the University. Jasper had been on the short list of
            candidates to row in the famous annual Boat Race against Cambridge University. If he had raced, he would
            immediately have been awarded his ‘blue’. The term comes from the colours sported by the Universities,
            Cambridge light blue and Oxford dark blue.</p>

        <p><strong>27 (26) Canning</strong> <br />
            A University political and debating society named after George Canning (1770-1827), Foreign Secretary in the
            Napoleonic and post-Napoleonic eras, and briefly Prime Minister. In his biography of Monsignor Ronald Knox,
            EW states that its members <em>met to read and discuss papers on political questions to the antiquated
                accompaniment of snuff-box, silver punch bowl, and churchwarden pipes</em>. This silver, according to EW
            in ALL, was lost during the war.</p>

        <p><strong>27 (26) J.C.R.</strong> <br />
            Junior Common Room, the chief organisation for the undergraduates of a college. It would have had some
            recognised powers in the running of college activities.</p>

        <p><strong>27-28 (26) Fuller’s walnut cake</strong> <br />
            Fuller’s was a tea-shop in Oxford whose cakes were proverbially delectable : Nancy Mitford also mentions its
            walnut cake as an expensive delicacy in <em>Love in a Cold Climate</em>. Like Lyon’s Corner Houses, Fuller’s
            Tea Rooms were to be found in many towns and cities. There was a middle-class ambience, partly because their
            waitresses dressed in black.</p>

        <p><strong>26 You’re reading History?</strong> [<em>Only in Br. Ed.</em>]<br />

        <p><strong>28 (26) basket-chair</strong> <br />
            A chair made of wickerwork or cane.</p>

        <p><strong>28 (26) The very worst is English literature</strong> <br />
            EW himself held this opinion all his life, though one of his daughters studied the subject. It was
            reinforced from the 1930’s by his distaste for the approach adopted at Cambridge University by Dr F.R.
            Leavis (1895-1978) and his disciples. Leavis believed that literature should be closely related to criticism
            of life and that critics should examine an author’s moral position.</p>

        <p><strong>28 (26) Modern Greats</strong> <br />
            a subject combination at the University. As EW says in ALL, it is now called ‘P.P.E.’, i.e. Politics,
            Philosophy and Economics. He calls it a <em>disreputable school</em> which was for ‘<em>publicists and
                politicians</em>’. A faculty with this name was created in Oxford in the 1920’s.</p>

        <p><strong>28 (26) first ... fourth</strong> <br />
            Classes of honours degree. A first is supreme, a sign of the highest talent and application; a fourth is the
            lowest pass and indicates at least considerable idleness. (A pass degree was lowest of all and did not count
            as an honours degree.)</p>

        <p><strong>28 (26) good second</strong> <br />
            Likewise a class of degree. At this time second class degrees were not split into two divisions (known as
            2-1 and 2-2) as they are today. So a student would have known that his second was good only if his tutor had
            told him, no doubt with pitying condescension, that he had <em>nearly</em> got a first.</p>

        <p><strong>28 (26) Arkwright on Demosthenes</strong> <br />
            Demosthenes (384-322 B.C.) was the great Athenian orator who opposed the Macedonian menace. His speeches
            have inspired writers, orators and politicians down to our own day. Arkwright was clearly a don whose
            lectures on Demosthenes were profound, informative and entertaining, though unfortunately I have not
            discovered if he actually existed.</p>

        <p><strong>28 (26) Clothes</strong> <br />
            Jasper’s strictures are intended to help Charles maintain a high standard, even if he goes into debt for a
            time. Ordinary students would wear tweed coats and flannel trousers because they were cheaper.</p>

        <p><strong>28 (26) Carlton </strong> <br />
            A Conservative political and social club with rooms in George Street, Oxford, to be distinguished in its
            importance from the major one in London though it attempted to sustain the atmosphere of a London club. EW
            was a member.</p>

        <p><strong>28 (26) Grid</strong> <br />
            i.e. the Gridiron, an exclusive dining and drinking club in Oxford.</p>

        <p><strong>28 (26) Chatham</strong> <br />
            Another political discussion society, named after William Pitt the Elder, Earl of Chatham (1708-1778). It
            had no site of its own but met in various college rooms. EW belonged to it at Oxford and states in ALL that
            they met <em>over mulled claret</em>.</p>

        <p id="Boar"><strong>28 (26) Keep clear of Boar’s Hill</strong><span id="cap15"></span><br />
            Boar’s Hill was a village to the south-west of Oxford. Many dons lived there. It was supposed to contain
            young females who were always on the lookout to entrap eligible young undergraduates into devotion,
            engagement and marriage. But a more likely explanation of Jasper’s aversion is that a number of ladies (e.g.
            Lady Keeble) maintained literary salons in Boar’s Hill which encouraged a stifling rather than liberating
            air of intellectual seriousness. These might on the other hand be sufficiently attractive to inveigle
            students away from their books to the delights of intelligent social discourse.</p>

        <p>There is a splendid and famous view of Oxford from Boar’s Hill.</p>

            Leander is a rowing club based at Henley, the members of which have been invited to join and so are a select
            band. In those days they were invariably university men. Its tie is in the club colours, pink.</p>

            Members of the Church of England who consider their church to be a full member of the Catholic Church and
            therefore accept all the doctrine and ritual of the Roman Catholic Church. The splendour of the ceremonies
            they arranged, which in general outshone those of the Romans, did attract showy homosexual males, but
            Jasper’s condemnation is no doubt excessive.</p>

        <p><strong>28 (27) hall</strong> <br />
            A certain number of dinners had to be eaten in college, in the dining hall. Some men would have had them all
            there - it was often cheaper to do this than to dine out at restaurants. The dinner was a formal occasion
            for which all the diners would have worn their academic gowns.</p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) gillyflowers</strong> <br />
            An old name for flowers of the pink or carnation family (pronounced ‘jilly-flowers’), with sweet-smelling
            scents reminiscent of cloves. (In England there was some confusion because the name was sometimes given to
            stocks and wallflowers also; these were often called <em>stock gillyflowers</em> and <em>wall
                gillyflowers</em>.)</p>

        <p><em>In the passage that follows, Charles wishes he had displayed a more mature and sophisticated taste when

        <p><strong>29 (27) Morris stuffs</strong><span id="cap17"></span><br />

        <p><strong>29 (27) Arundel prints</strong> <br />
            Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel (1595-1646) was the first great English art collector. He amassed a vast
            collection of art objects. Many classical statues and sculptures he excavated in Italy are now to be seen at
            the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. He was particularly fond of Flemish, Dutch, German, and Italian paintings of
            the sixteenth century, Dürer and Holbein being especial favourites.</p>

        <p>In his honour a society was formed in 1848 which had the aim of reproducing works by famous artists in order
            to promote public interest in art. It was wound up in 1897 but seven years later the Arundel Club was
            started to print reproductions of works otherwise inaccessible in private collections. The prints produced
            by both initiatives became popular with the art-loving general public.</p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) French novels of the second empire</strong> <br />
            The Second Empire lasted from 1852 to 1870 and had one ruler, Emperor Napoleon III. The novels he means are
            probably literary efforts by Hugo, the young Zola, Flaubert, Dumas <em>père</em> and <em>fils</em>, and the
            Goncourt brothers. In the circumstances they are unlikely to be the possible alternative, lighter and racier
            efforts of general appeal and no special distinction, the kind that were hidden behind cushions when
            unexpected visitors arrived.</p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) Russia-leather</strong> <br />
            Though Russia was for over a century the major world producer of high quality leather, Russia Leather was
            the term given to a soft kind of leather, made originally in Russia but later elsewhere, which has a
            characteristic odour from being treated with an oil obtained from birch bark. It was and is much used in
            bookbinding, as it is not susceptible to mould and resists the attentions of insects. </p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) watered-silk</strong> <br />
            There are several ways of making watered silk. A design can be printed on the warp before weaving so that,
            when finished, the silk looks as if it has been dampened. These days it is generally passed through a set of
            rollers as a fabric finishing process, to give the surface a moire pattern.</p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) Roger Fry</strong> <br />
            He was an art historian, critic, and painter (1866-1934), who played a vital role in introducing modern art
            to the British public. His predominant attitude may be detected in his statement : <em>The corruption of
                taste and the emotional insincerity of the mass of the people has gone so far that any picture which
                pleased more than 10% of the population should be immediately burned (<a class="link"
                    href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54154" target="_blank">Vision and Design</a>)</em>. As he was
            both a champion of early Modernism, especially through the two Post-Impressionist exhibitions that he
            organized in London in 1910 and 1912, and a member of the Bloomsbury Group, Fry was doubly antipathetic to
            EW, though he did read Fry’s books. Fry’s own painting was certainly second-rate at best.</p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) Provençal landscape</strong> <br />
            Provence is the most south-easterly of the provinces of France, a centre of high culture throughout much of
            the Middle Ages and for a time a kingdom in its own right. It is famous for its sun-soaked landscapes.</p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) Omega workshops</strong> <br />
            Roger Fry founded these in Fitzroy Square, London, in 1913 to produce decorated furniture, pottery, clothes,
            etc., according to his own aesthetic principles. (The site at number 33 is now the London Foot Hospital &
            School of Podiatric Medicine.) The artefacts created here displayed the influence of Post-Impressionism,
            Bohemianism, and African folk art and were simple in design and brightly coloured. World War I and Fry’s
            autocratic temperament prevented the natural growth of the venture and it foundered in 1919.</p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) McKnight Kauffer</strong><span id="cap19"></span><br />
            Edward McKnight Kauffer (1891-1954) was a talented American designer. He made his reputation in England
            designing posters in the 20’s and 30’s, e.g. for London Transport (to be displayed on hoardings and in
            stations) and for Shell Oil. McKnight Kauffer was also a prolific and striking book illustrator and
            attempted stage design with some success.</p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) Rhyme Sheets from the Poetry Bookshop</strong><span id="cap20"></span><br />
            Illustrated sheets of favourite poems, extremely popular with everybody. The Poetry Bookshop also published
            collections in book form of the popular poets of the age as well as of classics, often with decorative
            detail and illustrations by leading practitioners of the art including Claud Lovat Fraser, whom EW much
            admired.</p>

        <p>The Poetry Bookshop, which flourished in Devonshire Street, London, from 1913 to 1935, was opened and run by
            the poet Harold Monro (1879-1932) and in later years by his widow Alida. While it existed, the Poetry
            Bookshop was a natural centre for writers in London : Edward Thomas, Robert Frost and Wilfred Owen (among
            others) actually lived on the premises for a time.</p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) <em>Vision and Design</em></strong> <br />
            Roger Fry’s most influential book, published in 1920. It expressed his admiration of strong design in art,
            especially cubism in painting. For him, <em>form</em> took precedence over <em>content</em> : that is, how a
            work looks rather than what it is about. He thought that artists should use colour and arrangement of forms
            rather than the subject to express their ideas and feelings. Works of art should not be judged by how
            accurately they represent reality. Clive Bell thought much the same. Despite Ryder’s strictures, (<a
                class="link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54154" target="_blank"><em>Vision and
                    Design</em></a>) is not a meagre and commonplace book. </p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) the Medici Press edition of <em>A Shropshire Lad</em></strong> <br />
            Almost certainly EW means the Medici Society edition. Philip Lee Warner and Eustace Gurney founded the
            Medici Society in 1908 to <em>bring artists’ work to the appreciation of a wider public</em>. Their
            publications were elegant and attractive, and the Society exists to this day. It was the Riccardi Press,
            created in 1909 to service the Medici Society, that actually printed this volume, in 1914; it was in fact a
            reprint of an 1896 edition.</p>

        <p><a class="link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5720" target="_blank"><em>A Shropshire Lad</em></a> by
            A.E. Housman (1859-1936) was by 1923 an extremely popular book of poetry with the public; it had first been
            published in 1896. It contains poetry with a unique blend of folk ballad and classical structure whose main
            themes are thwarted love, despair and failure and whose main mood is melancholy. In poetic circles the
            reaction against Housman was setting in by 1923, as can be seen in the following parody by Hugh Kingsmill
            (though he should have used the word ‘lad’) :<br />

                Risley in </em>Maurice<em> by E. M. Forster</em>] published in 1918. The four biographies (of Cardinal
            Manning, Dr Thomas Arnold, Florence Nightingale and General Gordon) were written with the intention of
            displaying flaws. He did not easily let truth get in the way.</p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) <em>Georgian Poetry</em></strong> <br />
            The Georgian poets were the English poets who came to middle age in the period 1910-1920 (the first years of
            King George V’s reign). Their poetry was generally conventional in form, lyrical in style, and safe (not to
            say banal) in subject. Its influence was swept away by the impacts of modernism and World War I. The Poetry
            Bookshop published the first of five volumes of <a class="link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9484"
                target="_blank"><em>Georgian Poetry</em></a>, dealing with poetry of the years 1911-12 and edited by
            Edward Marsh, in 1913. Later volumes dealt with the years 1913-15, 1916-17, 1918-19 and 1920-22.</p>

            A novel by Compton Mackenzie (1883-1972) published in 1913. EW loved it as a young man and so did I; in his
            diary for 24th June 1920 he wrote, <em>It is incomparably good and I am quite delighted</em>. Book Three
            (‘<em>Dreaming Spires</em>’) is set in Oxford near the turn of the 20th century. Cyril Connolly, one of EW’s
            contemporaries at Oxford, says, however, that the book <em>is a work of inflation, important because it is
                the first of a long line of bad books (Enemies of Promise)</em>. John Betjeman on the other hand says
            that <em>that section is a classic in itself, where Oxford novel-writing is concerned (An Oxford University
                Chest : Notes on Some Oxford Novels)</em>.</p>

            Connolly : <em>a book, which ... remains a flower of the intellectual school (ibid)</em>. EW himself thought
            it <em>the only great satirical novel of his (Douglas’s) generation</em>.</p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) Wykehamist</strong> <br />
            A man who went to school at Winchester College (pronounced ‘Wickam-ist’). The name comes from the college’s
            founder William of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester (1324-1404). Wykehamists were considered serious, clannish
            and ambitious.</p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) ‘aesthetes’</strong> <br />
            Until EW’s generation came to Oxford in about 1923 the aesthetes were merely pale shadows of famous figures
            like Oscar Wilde from what was then the distant past, the last thirty years of the previous century. Their
            leading figures were untalented loafers who gave the impression of mooning about Oxford to no effect. EW’s
            friend Harold Acton set out to develop a new kind of aesthete, an actively creative person of taste and wide
            culture. In doing this, perhaps not inadvertently, he saddled his followers with that oddity of dress,
            ‘Oxford bags’, i.e. exceptionally wide-legged trousers.</p>

        <p><strong>29 (27) Iffley Road ... Wellington Square</strong> <br />
            Places in Oxford where cheaper lodgings could then be found. In his Isis article on Harold Acton EW wrote :
            There was a grim pipe-smoking intelligentsia who lived in Wellington Square. The square’s charms have not
            been increased in recent times by modern building, including the University Offices.</p>

        <p><strong>29 (29) sixth form</strong> <br />
            In independent and many grammar schools, this was the final stage of a pupil’s educational career before
            going on to university. Usually it was for youngsters of the ages of 16, 17 and 18. This stage is now known
            as Years 12 and 13. The American equivalent is the Eleventh and Twelfth Grades. <br />
            [<em>Ed. Note: The third line is only in the Am. Ed.</em>]</p>

        <p><strong>30 (28) Significant Form</strong> <br />
            An artistic theory first promulgated by Clive Bell (1881-1964) in his book <a class="link"
                href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16917" target="_blank"><em>Art</em></a> (1914). He asserted that
            the relationships and combinations of lines and colours were the most important elements in works of art.
            The aesthetic emotion aroused in the viewer by a painting, he states, derives primarily from his
            apprehension of these elements (which Bell called its ‘significant form’), rather than from his
            understanding of its subject matter.</p>

        <p>Collins is arguing that if the subject of a painting is not important in understanding it, then there is no
            basis for judging it to be ‘sentimental’ and so condemning it as worthless, as was often the practice
            especially among those who supported Bell.</p>

        <p>Charles understands the issues better when, soon after, Sebastian rejects one of Bell’s arguments. Bell
            believed that created forms (a cathedral, a painting) were superior to forms created in nature (flowers, a
            butterfly) because a perceptive and aesthetic mind used to manipulating formal patterning had produced them.
        </p>

        <p>EW thoroughly detested the views of modern critics such as Bell and Roger Fry. Though he cannot be considered
            a lover of nature in a regular mould, he did like to detect in art a similarity to real life. Indeed he
            developed, much against prevailing fashion, a taste for Victorian genre painting in which there was a strong
            narrative and realistic element.</p>

            A barber’s shop in Oxford.</p>

        <p id="Flyte"><strong>30 (28) Lord Sebastian Flyte</strong> <br />
            As the Marquess’s second son, Sebastian is formally titled Lord Sebastian Flyte. If he had later had a son
            the boy would have been a commoner and would not succeed to a lordship. In this way the British aristocracy
            kept itself small in numbers, a characteristic not found in most of the rest of Europe, where all sons had
            titles and often rights of inheritance. Thus British aristocrats retained large estates while many
            continental ones were reduced over time to owning nearly nothing. (NB later Lord Marchmain will bequeath the
            whole Brideshead estate to Julia. His sons could not even by legal action prevent him from doing this.)</p>

        <p>The most notable person to demonstrate this jettisoning effect at the time of writing is the Queen’s
            grandson, Mr Peter Phillips, who is a commoner though his mother is the Princess Royal and he is tenth in
            line of succession to the Crown.</p>

        <p><strong>30 (28) Marquis of Marchmain</strong> <br />
            A marquess is second in rank only to a duke in lay precedence in the House of Lords. It ranks above earl,
            viscount, baron and all other inherited titles outside the royal family. In general speech he would be
            called ‘Lord Marchmain’.</p>

        <p>It is notable that EW did not choose to spell the title <em>Marquess</em>. In a letter to Anthony Powell
            (31st May 1956) he gave as his justification the fact that Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India and nearly Prime
            Minister, had preferred <em>Marquis</em>. Nearly all others of that rank, however, prefer
            <em>>Marquess</em>, the exceptions being Scottish marquises whose titles were created before the Union with
            England (1707).
        </p>

        <p><strong>30 (28) Earl of Brideshead</strong> <br />
            A peer’s eldest son is entitled to take his father’s second title as a courtesy while his father is alive.
            It must rank below that of his father. Likewise, the peer’s third title, lower ranking still, can be taken
            by his eldest son’s first son.</p>

        <p><strong>30 (28) Aloysius</strong> <br />
            Sebastian’s teddy bear has a remarkable name (pronounced ‘al-oo-ish-us’). He is almost certainly named after
            Saint Aloysius Gonzaga (1568-1591), a young Jesuit who died shortly before ordination while nursing plague
            victims whom he refused to abandon. Saint Aloysius was, and still is, the patron of youth. He is also the
            patron of the Roman Catholic parish in Oxford.</p>

        <p><strong>30 (28) George</strong> <br />
            the George Inn in George Street, now demolished. EW thought its food expensive and bad but often ate there.
            In ALL he calls it a wretched restaurant which was the fashion. John Betjeman in <a class="link"
                href="https://archive.org/details/oxforduniversity0000betj_t8i9" target="_blank"><em>An Oxford
                    University Chest</em></a> (1937) writes, however : <em>There is no really good restaurant in Oxford,
                the nearest approach to one being The George where Madame et Monsieur Ersham as host and hostess are
                known to generations of undergraduates</em>. (Chapter 4)</p>

        <p><strong>30 (29) Freud</strong> <br />
            The works of the psychoanalyst Siegmund Freud (1856-1939) were making rapid progress in Britain at this
            time. EW was dubious about his theories but interested in them.</p>

        <p><strong>31 (29) mulled claret</strong> <br />
            A delicious drink when prepared well, and most welcome on winter evenings. The simplest preparation is to
            put a red-hot poker fresh from the fire into a tankard of wine, but most recipes insist on additions :
            spices, sugar, lemon, etc. My advice is to underdo the spices as much as possible. EW himself volunteered a
            recipe to <em>As We Like It : Cookery Recipes by Famous People</em>, a book published in 1950, which stated
            : <br />

        <div style="margin-left: 50px;"><em>Take 6 bottles of red wine (it would be improper to use really fine
                Bordeaux, but the better the wine, the better the concoction). Any sound claret or burgundy will do. One
                cupful of water; 2 port glasses of brandy; 1 port glass of ginger wine; 1 orange stuffed with cloves;
                peel of 2 lemons; 3 sticks of cinnamon; 1 grated nutmeg. Heat in covered cauldron. Do not allow to
                simmer. Serve hot and keep hot on the hob. Should be drunk at same temperature as tea.</em></div>

        <p><strong>31 (29) metaphysics</strong> <br />
            A division of philosophy concerned with the nature of reality and existence.</p>

        <p><strong>31 (29) House</strong> <br />
            ‘The House’ is the common nickname for Christ Church College, which is Sebastian’s college. It derives from
            its Latin title, <em>Aedes Christi</em> (House of Christ). </p>

        <p><strong>31 (29) till Tom stops ringing</strong><span id="cap24"></span><br />
            The large bell at Christ Church College is known as Great Tom. Its most famous tolling is 101 strokes at
            9.05 p.m. Since it was distinctive and could be heard all over Oxford, the proctors used this signal as the
            time by which gated students had to be back in their college. By the last stroke of midnight all students of
            Christ Church had to be in the grounds of the college.</p>

        <p>In ALL EW states that the Hertford College gates were closed at 9 p.m., after which time no-one could go out
            and no visitor was allowed in. Students already out could return to college normally until 11 o’clock, but
            if they returned from 11 to midnight their names were taken and they had to pay a small fine. After midnight
            nobody was allowed in, which meant that climbing walls and roofs was necessary.</p>

        <p><strong>31 (29) he was sick</strong> <br />
            Anthony Bushell, an Oxford friend of EW’s who became an accomplished actor (he played Sir Andrew Ffoulkes in
            the 1934 film of <em>The Scarlet Pimpernel</em>), stated that EW was himself the victim of such an unwelcome
            intrusion in his ground-floor rooms at Hertford.</p>

        <p><strong>31 (29) Etonian</strong> <br />
            A former pupil of the prestigious independent school Eton College, which is situated near Slough. Sebastian
            Flyte is an Etonian.</p>

        <p><strong>32 (30) five shillings</strong> <br />
            A shilling was a coin in the currency which was legal tender in Britain until the early 1970’s, when decimal
            currency replaced it and the name disappeared. 20 shillings made up one pound (£) and 12 pence a shilling.
            Five shillings was therefore a quarter of a pound (or 25p in modern terms).</p>

        <p><strong>32 (30) <em>conté</em> crayon</strong> <br />
            A hard drawing crayon made of clay and graphite named in honour of a French inventor, Nicolas Conté
            (1755-1805).</p>

        <p><strong>32 (30) Whatman H.P. drawing paper</strong> <br />
            Among the best art paper, a fact of which Sebastian is either unaware or careless. It is particularly
            suitable for fine watercolour or pen and ink work. Whatman paper has been used by English artists back to
            Gainsborough and Turner. H.P. stands for Hot Pressed; the paper has a very smooth surface which is achieved
            in the manufacture by pressure between heated surfaces.</p>

        <p><strong>32 (30) commons</strong> <br />
            Cheap food supplied by the college (e.g. bread and cheese), eaten away from the college hall.</p>

        <p><strong>32 (31) enchanted garden</strong> <br />
            The theme of an enchanted garden was powerful at this time because of the popularity of books such as <a
                class="link" href="https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/17396" target="_blank"><em>The Secret Garden</em></a>
            (1911) by Frances Hodgson Burnett (1849-1924) and <a class="link" href="https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/16389"
                target="_blank"><em>The Enchanted April</em></a> (1922) by Elizabeth von Arnim (1866-1941), not to
            mention <a class="link" href="https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/19033" target="_blank"><em>Alice in
                    Wonderland</em></a> (1865) by Lewis Carroll (pseudonym of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, 1832–1898). The
            growing dehumanisation of industrialised and urbanised society encouraged such thoughts of escape to natural
            beauty and contentment; the similarity to Arcadia is notable.</p>

        <p><strong>33 (31) Meadow Buildings</strong><span id="cap25"></span><br />
            Meadow Buildings had been built in the Venetian style in the middle of the 19th century and were in the
            general estimation of the period the ugliest in Christ Church College, which otherwise had splendid
            Renaissance and neo-classical architecture. They are not considered so ugly today. EW puts Sebastian there
            because this is where his friend Harold Acton chose to domicile himself as a deliberate act of homage to
            mid-Victorian values.</p>

            A small organ given voice by bellows operated by the player’s feet. We do not discover whether Sebastian is
            truly musical.</p>

        <p><strong>33 (31) gothic case</strong><span id="cap26"></span><br />
            The Gothic period of art and architecture lasted from the 12th to the 15th centuries. The case for this
            harmonium would have been built in a style suggested by gothic themes. Artistic effects would be created by
            a suggestion of pointed arches, vaulting and columns and the use of such Gothic emblems as fleurs-de-lys,
            quatrefoils, chevrons and embrasures.</p>

        <p><strong>33 (31) London hostesses</strong> <br />
            These are the great ladies of London high society who ask the latest sensational young man to grace their
            dances. Some of them would be looking for husbands for their daughters.</p>

        <p><strong>31 in the bedder</strong> [<em>Only in Am. Ed.</em>]<br />
            i.e. youthful slang for <em>in the bedroom</em>. In British editions of the novel the phrase used is just
            next door. It is odd that this typically English nickname survives only in the American edition of the
            novel. EW may have quickly changed it for the British editions because at Cambridge University a bedder is a
            bedmaker, i.e. a college servant (what Oxford called a <em>scout</em>), and he wished to avoid carping
            hilarity on his phraseology.</p>

        <p><strong>33 (32) They always lay early for her</strong> <br />
            The first mention of Lady Marchmain is remarkable. Sebastian implies that she is so dominating that even
            birds obey her wishes.</p>

        <p><strong>34 (32) lobster Newburg</strong> <br />
            A dish in which chunks of lobster are presented in a sherry and cream sauce.</p>

        <p><strong>34 (32) <em>F-f-footer</em></strong> <br />
            i.e. football, probably rugby. The idea of Anthony Blanche playing rugby football is ludicrous.</p>

        <p><strong>34 (32) from Cherwell Edge to Somerville</strong> <br />
            This phrase means <em>among the women undergraduates of Oxford</em>. Cherwell Edge was a convent-hostel for
            Catholic women undergraduates in the east of the city, in the care of the Holy Child Jesus sisters and
            Jesuit priests. It was situated near the River Cherwell, naturally, and is today the site of Linacre
            College. Somerville College was until the 1990’s a college for women only.</p>

        <p><strong>34 (33) megaphone</strong><span id="cap29"></span><br />
            Megaphones had some cultural currency at this time. EW’s Oxford friend Harold Acton used to recite poems,
            not just <a class="link" href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47311/the-waste-land"
                target="_blank"><em>The Waste Land</em></a> but his own and those of the Sitwells, through a megaphone.
            Crooners with weak voices used them on pier heads, beaches and even the stage. In 1923, in the entertainment
            <em>Façade</em> and to the music of William Walton, Edith Sitwell recited her own poems through a megaphone
            (actually a Sengerphone) inserted into a decorated traverse curtain.

        <p><strong>34 (33) <em>The Waste Land</em></strong> <br />
            The great poem by T.S. Eliot (1888-1965), just published in 1922. The lines that Blanche quotes come from
            Part 3, <em>The Fire Sermon</em>, and in particular the section dealing with the loveless coupling of the
            typist and <em>the young man carbuncular</em>. Though EW was by 1944 generally unsympathetic to modern art
            in all its forms, Eliot’s poetry seems to have had a fascination for him from the time Harold Acton
            introduced it to him; in his <em>Diary</em> he called the poems ‘incredibly good’ (13th January 1926). The
            title of EW’s novel <em>A Handful of Dust</em> is taken from <em>The Waste Land</em>.</p>

        <p><strong>34 (33) Grace Darlings</strong> <br />
            A reference to a great heroine of Victorian times (1815-1842). In 1838 she and her father William Darling,
            the keeper of the Longstone lighthouse on the Farne Islands, managed to launch a small boat and row a mile
            through a storm to rescue four men and a woman clinging to a rock. This effort was all the more remarkable
            because she was consumptive; she died four years later.</p>

        <p><strong>34 (33) Cointreau</strong> <br />
            The liqueur from France made chiefly from orange peel, from both sweet and bitter oranges. It has been made
            since 1849.</p>

        <p><strong>34 (33) ‘Home they brought her warrior dead’</strong> <br />
            The words are from <a class="link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/791/791-h/791-h.htm"
                target="_blank"><em>The Princess</em></a> by Alfred Lord Tennyson (1809-1892). The great composer Gustav
            Holst <a class="link" href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Songs_from_'The_Princess',_Op.20a_(Holst,_Gustav)"
                target="_blank">set these words</a> in 1905, but the song is more likely to be that by Lily Teresa
            Strickland (1887-1958) , whose setting had recently been published [<em>Ed. Note: Published under the title
                "As through the Land at Eve"—I can find no good recordings online.</em>]. The lugubrious nature of the
            song can be judged from the first verse : <br />

        <div style="margin-left: 50px;"><em>Home they brought her warrior dead, <br />
                She neither swoon’d nor utter’d cry: <br />
                All her maidens, watching, said, <br />
                ‘She must weep or she must die.’</em></div>
        </p>

        <p><strong>35 (33) stick you full of barbed arrows like a p-p-pin-cushion</strong><span id="cap30"></span><br />
            This statement seems so unmotivated and violent that it has attracted much attention. Perhaps Sebastian’s
            exquisite control of situation and manners has irked Blanche’s sense of his own unique impressiveness in
            company. In any case he has chosen a famous image from art and martyrology to express his ambivalence
            towards Sebastian : he is referring to the manner of the death of Sebastian’s sainted namesake : Saint
            Sebastian was used as a target for archers.</p>

        <p>Some see in this reference a homosexual meaning. Saint Sebastian, in one legend, was killed for refusing, out
            of Christian righteousness, to admit the sexual advances of a superior officer. Perhaps, they think, Blanche
            is alluding to a refusal by Sebastian to accommodate his passion for the <em>epicene beauty</em> (page 33)
            that Ryder also notices in his friend.</p>

        <p><strong>35 (33) Botanical Gardens</strong><span id="cap31"></span><br />
            The University has its own botanical garden on the High Street opposite Magdalen College. It was founded in
            1621, when it was known as the Oxford Physick Garden.</p>

        <p><strong>35 (34) Merton</strong> <br />
            Merton claims to be the oldest college in the University. It possibly is, though University College claims
            to have been founded by King Alfred in 872! Sebastian and Charles are obviously walking down Merton Street
            rather than the busier High Street, which is parallel.</p>

        <p><strong>35 (34) another hour</strong> <br />
            The timing is revealing. They left Oxford at nine o’clock and drove for two hours, leaving Swindon behind
            them before stopping for wine and strawberries. They then drove for another hour (three in all so far) and
            then dined at the farmhouse inn. They drove on after an unspecified lunchtime and for an unspecified period
            before arriving ‘in the early afternoon’. They can hardly have driven for much less than a total of four
            hours. On the roads of that time they could not have averaged much above 20 m.p.h., which puts Brideshead at
            (say) between 60 and 100 miles from Oxford.</p>

        <p><strong>36 (34) old house </strong><span id="cap32"></span><br />
            17th/18th century, as we learn later. Much of the description of Brideshead is reminiscent of Castle Howard
            which the splendid television production actually used for the exteriors. That great house, however, is in
            Yorkshire. EW took some details of the chapel from his memories of Madresfield Court, the seat of his
            friends the Lygon family. Madresfield is not far from Malvern, a few miles from where the
            Warwickshire/Worcestershire Avon joins the River Severn. Later we find out that Brideshead is not in
            Yorkshire, Warwickshire or Worcestershire.</p>

        <p><strong>36 (35) in London</strong> <br />
            In high society, June is the height of the season. The London season lasts from early May to early August,
            when the opening of the shooting season drives sportsmen and their families to their country estates.</p>

        <p><strong>36 (35) Nanny Hawkins</strong> <br />
            A nanny brought up almost every child born into a well-off family at this time. She was employed full-time
            to take care of the children, living in the family home and often developing a closer relationship with them
            than did their mother. After their childhood the nanny would sometimes stay on as a favoured retired
            servant, as Nanny Hawkins does here.</p>

        <p><strong>36 (35) obelisk</strong><span id="cap35"></span><br />
            A memorial column, based on Egyptian models or (more likely here) originally from Egypt even if transported
            first to Italy, as often happened. Obelisks were long, thin, four-sided shafts with a pyramid at the top. In
            ancient Egypt, pairs of them often flanked temple entrances.</p>

            The Conservative Party has been one of the two main political parties in Britain since the 1830’s; before
            that it was called the Tory Party, as by common usage it still is. The ladies’ group forms a strong element
            in every local political party. They would meet for an afternoon at least once a month for discussion and
            tea.</p>

        <p><strong>37 (36) Agricultural</strong> <br />
            i.e. the Agricultural Show, which takes place at Brideshead once a year. (It is described on page 85.) The
            farmers, landowners and land workers would meet to discuss the state of agriculture, see the latest
            developments and compete for prizes for the best produce and animals.</p>

        <p><strong>38 (36) bringing out ... débutante</strong> <br />
            When a girl from a ‘good’ family reached the age of 17 she was introduced into society, often to search for
            a husband, by attending a ball arranged in her honour. This was called ‘coming out’; their mothers were
            ‘bringing them out’. At this time there were also a Debutantes’ Ball and a ceremony at court at which they
            were all formally presented to the King and Queen. For the rest of this first season of their adulthood they
            were known as debutantes. The newspapers followed the whole series of events closely.</p>

        <p><strong>38 (36) cut her hair</strong><span id="cap36"></span><br />
            By 1923 the craze in fashion for young women to look like young men was well advanced. Short hair was

        <p><strong>38 (37) oleograph</strong> <br />
            The earliest form of colour reproduction. It involved preparing a separate stone by hand for each colour to
            be used and printing one colour over another. It was the most popular method of colour reproduction until
            the end of the 19th century.</p>

        <p><strong>38 (37) Sacred Heart</strong><span id="cap37"></span><br />
            A picture then seen in almost every Catholic home, representing Jesus with his heart red, prominent and
            radiantly shining, though circled by thorns. The picture was an expression of a characteristic Catholic
            devotion not entirely unknown today. I still see oleographs of the Sacred Heart in the houses of older
            Catholics.</p>

            from the stone are rare and highly prized.</p>

        <p><strong>39 (38) Queen Alexandra’s Day</strong> <br />
            Soon called Alexandra Rose Day, this was an annual day of charitable giving created by Queen Alexandra
            (1844-1925), wife of King Edward VII, to raise money for hospitals. The family opens Brideshead to the
            public on this day. In modern times the Alexandra Rose Day organisation co-ordinates the efforts of many
            small charities to raise money on this day.</p>

            Scagliola is an artificial material which imitated marble but was made out of plaster of Paris coloured by
            the addition of pigments. The early Italian examples of scagliola imitated marble all the more successfully
            because they did contain a surface created partially with marble dust. It was of course far cheaper than
            marble though the process for making it is skilled and time-consuming.</p>

        <p><strong>39 (38) <em>art nouveau</em></strong><span id="cap45"></span><br />
            an ornamental style of art that flourished between about 1890 and 1910 throughout Europe and the United
            States. Art Nouveau (which means <em>the new art</em>) is characterized by its use of a long, sinuous line
            which is more important than other pictorial elements such as form, texture, space, and colour. Themes and
            ornamentation are usually taken from nature.</p>

        <p><strong>39 (38) water stoup</strong><span id="cap47"></span><br />
            In all Catholic churches and chapels there is by the entrance a basin, often of stone, containing holy
            water. Catholics dip the tips of their fingers in and make the sign of the cross as they enter and leave.

        <p><strong>39 (38) genuflected</strong> <br />
            Sebastian dropped onto one knee (possibly while making the sign of the cross) and then rose again. This is a
            common Catholic mode of acknowledging one’s presence before God in a church.</p>

        <p><strong>39 (38) arts-and-crafts style</strong><span id="cap48"></span><br />
            The Arts and Crafts Movement was an English aesthetic movement of the second half of the 19th century. It
            was the beginning of a new appreciation of the decorative arts throughout Europe. In 1861 William Morris,
            disgusted by the artistic banality of modern domestic arts, founded a firm of interior decorators and
            manufacturers dedicated to recapturing the spirit and quality of medieval craftsmanship. Morris and his
            companions produced handcrafted metalwork, jewellery, wallpaper, textiles, furniture, and books. This
            movement influenced Art Nouveau, but is not to be confused with it.</p>

        <p>Brideshead chapel is a good example of it, and is a pretty accurate account of the chapel at Madresfield
            Court. The angels painted on the walls at Madresfield are portraits of EW’s friends as children.</p>

            In Catholic churches, where the Blessed Sacrament (the body of Christ under the appearance of bread) is
            nearly always present in the tabernacle, a red light in a hanging lamp usually signifies the fact. At this
            period the lamp would have been an oil lamp.</p>

            An independent country when Austria-Hungary forced war on it in August 1914, so beginning World War I.
            Admiration for the Serbs was widespread in Britain. From 1919 it was a constituent part of the Kingdom of
            the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, a political entity forced on the South Slavs by the peacemakers which, known
            as Yugoslavia from 1929, had a precarious unity for seventy-three years.</p>

            The hamlet of Wolvercote lies on the river Thames north-west of Oxford. Nearby are the ruins of Godstow
            Abbey and a lock. The Trout Inn was constructed from one of the ruined buildings in the 17th century. There
            is a splendid view of Oxford from its grounds. The Trout Inn was one of EW’s favourite drinking-places; it
            has achieved more eminence recently as a location for one of the episodes in the T.V. series <em>Inspector
                Morse</em> (as indeed have several Oxford pubs).</p>
