    <section class="brideshead-section body">
         <p> I hope that the following chart will be useful for tracing the order of events in <em><strong>Brideshead Revisited</strong></em> or for judging what is happening at the same time. I give two columns, one basically for Charles and Sebastian, and the other for Julia and Rex. Of course their lives do intertwine considerably, but I believe that the division is helpful. <br /></p>

         <p>One has also to remember that Evelyn Waugh was not always meticulous about his dates or the ages of his characters, so that some of the points enumerated here could be questioned. For example, Julia’s birth date is not precisely enough indicated for me to be sure that she was born in 1905.</p>
