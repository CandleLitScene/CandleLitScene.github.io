        <p><strong>9 (3) 'C' Company</strong> <br />
            There are four rifle companies in this battalion, named after the first four letters of the alphabet. Charles Ryder commands C Company. Each company has three platoons; one of Ryder’s platoons is commanded by Mr Hooper. Each platoon would usually have three squads of twelve men each. The officer in charge of a company would be a captain (as Ryder is), that of a battalion usually a colonel (probably not a full colonel). </p>
            <p>There would be two or more battalions in a regiment, which would have a historically strong connexion to a base territory in Britain. To form a brigade, which had no such territorial loyalty, individual battalions could be drawn from several regiments. The brigade would naturally be headed by a brigadier. </p>
            <p>Battalions were always infantry organisations, but the term <em>regiment</em> was used by all branches of the army, including artillery and cavalry. (In fact in 1939 the British Army was the only army in the world which had dispensed with all horse cavalry for military use.)</p>

        <p><strong>9 (3) tram lines</strong> <br />
            Metal rails on which ran public conveyances (‘trams’) which worked on electricity supplied by overhead cables.</p>
        
        <p><strong>9 (3) Glasgow</strong> <br />
            Large and ancient city of western Scotland. Pollock Camp (a real place) was to the south-west of the city, within sound and sight of it, and obviously not far from the docks on the River Clyde. In his <em>Diary</em> EW described Pollock Camp as ‘a housing estate cut out of a park with concrete roads and no houses. A few smoke-blackened trees remain. We had huts, without water this time …’ The housing estate had been left incomplete at the beginning of the war. <be /></p>

        <p><strong>3 conductress</strong> [<em>Only in Am. Ed.</em>] <br />
            A uniformed woman responsible for the collection of money and issue of tickets on the trams to and from Glasgow. Women took over this kind of job during the war to free men for fighting.</p>

        <p><strong>9 (3) guard-room</strong> <br/>
            A room, usually at the entrance into a camp, used by soldiers detailed to be guards and as a temporary prison.</p>
        
        <p><strong>9 (3) cinemas</strong> <br />
            No doubt these are mentioned because, along with dance-halls, they supplied entertainment that was available for the soldiers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>10 (4) municipal lunatic asylum</strong> <br />
            A facility for the incarceration and treatment of people deemed incapable through madness. Doctors would admit patients on certification. This one is run by the local authority.</p>

        <p><strong>10 (4) happy collaborationists … enjoying their heritage at their ease.</strong> <br />
            The enemy with whom the madmen collaborate appears to be madness itself, presented as the enemy of everyday life. But, to EW’s way of thinking, normal life - represented here as ‘a century of progress’ - is itself inimical to mankind’s true nature and aspirations. So the response of these particularly sensitive inmates is to flee the world around them and so achieve happiness.</p>

        <p><strong>10 (4) Hooper</strong>
            Mr Hooper, as the representative of the burgeoning power of the lower classes and a symbol of the decay of the old civilisation, is an interesting creation. His views about the asylum inmates are gross and unfeeling. One wonders who else would fall under a ban in a world run by Hoopers. <br />

            EW may have taken his name from Hilaire Belloc’s <a class="link" href="https://www.babelmatrix.org/works/en/Belloc%2C_Hilaire-1870/Ballade_of_Genuine_Concern" target="_blank"><em>Ballade of Genuine Concern</em></a>. In the middle of a description of a series of national disasters occur these lines : <br />
            
                <div style="margin-left: 50px;"><em>England, my England, can the news be true? <br />
                Cannot the Duke be got to come to town? <br />
                Or will not Mr Hooper pull us through? </em></div> <br />
            
            The implied but obvious answer is ‘No’. The refrain to the ballade may have suggested to EW the great image of the conclusion of the book : <br />
            
            <div style="margin-left: 50px;"><em>The ice is breaking up on every side.</em></div>
            </p>

        <p><strong>10 (4) ‘Hitler would put them in a gas chamber,’ he said</strong> <br />
            The plan to exterminate the unfit in Germany dated from a secret decree signed by the German Führer in 1939. The principles of eugenics on which this decree was based date back to the nineteenth century and were in origin stimulated by the latest scientific ideas. Charles Darwin’s cousin Francis Galton (1822-1911) applied Darwin’s theory of evolution to a deliberate policy of social intervention in order to improve the stock of the human race. His proposals were given a distinctive tinge by being mingled with the ideas of the French writer and diplomat Joseph-Arthur comte de Gobineau (1816-1882), who published his Essay on the Inequality of Human Races in 1853. He taught the superiority of the white race and, among them, of the Aryans as the peak of civilization. Gobineau’s most important follower was Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1844-1927), an Englishman who lived and taught in Germany and whom Hitler acknowledged as his scientific mentor. Chamberlain argued further that certain races (the Jews, the black races) were inferior and degenerate and were liable to contaminate the purity and health of the white races.</p>
            <p>Early eugenicists (who had a respectable place in society in the early twentieth century and actually achieved dedicated professorial chairs in the universities) often argued for sterilisation programmes which would keep the perceived threat of racial degeneration at bay. They were also the firmest supporters of programmes of legalised euthanasia. But only in Nazi Germany were their ideas put into rigorous practice. Sterilisation of the ‘unfit’ was authorised in the thirties, and extermination on a grander scale from 1939. As a result of Hitler’s decree eight ‘hospital’ centres were set up in Germany in which many thousands of people deemed to be mentally unfit were killed. These centres were closed down and moved abroad from 1941 when disquiet about the deaths of so many apparently physically fit people began to spread in Germany itself. </p>

            <p>It is just possible that Hooper could have heard about these activities by this stage of the war.</p>

        <p><strong>10 (4) Middle East</strong>
            Probably Egypt, but possibly Syria or what was called Palestine (now Israel).</p>

        <p><strong>10 (4) compassionate leave</strong> <br />
            Leave granted for some domestic or personal reason which requires the soldier’s attention.</p>

        <p><strong>11 (5) the outbreak of war</strong> <br />
            World War II started on 3rd September 1939 when France and Great Britain declared war on Germany after German forces had invaded Poland on 1st September. Since Ryder soon compares his feelings about the army to ‘the fourth year of his marriage’ to a now-unloved wife and we know that the first leaves of spring are unfolding and that it is three months since they arrived at a time when snow covered the area (page 9), it seems that the date is February or March 1943, probably the latter month. But later (page 23) Ryder states that it was more than twenty years since he had first been to Brideshead with Sebastian and as we know that was in June 1923 (page 24), it is just as likely to be early 1944. To my mind, 1943 is a likelier date because this was a year of aimless wanderings by army units; by 1944 the invasion of Normandy was in active preparation and everything was far more purposeful. <br /> [<em>Ed. note: The Am Ed. starts with "For Europeans"</em>]</p>

        <p><strong>11 volunteered for special service</strong> [<em>Only in Br. Ed.</em>] <br />
            Special Forces was the title for such organisations as the Commandos and the Special Air Service (S.A.S.), formed early in the war to maintain an offensive posture against the otherwise all-conquering Germans. EW himself joined the Commandos; Charles clearly did not.

        <p><strong>11 (5) conscripts</strong> <br />
            Soldiers who had been forced into the army by being called up instead of volunteering willingly. Ryder is suggesting that the quality of officer suffered as a result - a different class of man from the well-educated and well-bred career officers he knew earlier has appeared in the mess. </p>

        <p><strong>11 (5) wireless</strong> <br />
            An older term for a radio. EW was implacably opposed to having a radio in his living room all his life (when he once wanted to hear an interview that he had recorded, he had the cook’s wireless brought in from the kitchen), so it is not surprising that Charles dislikes its eternal noise in the ante-room.</p>

        <p><strong>11 ante-room</strong> [<em>Only in Br. Ed.</em>] <br />
            A smaller room which opens into a larger, more important one such as, here, the dining-room. </p>

        <p><strong>11 (5) much beer was drunk before dinner</strong> <br />
            Charles gives this fact as evidence of a decline in standards. The point is not so much that the officers drink beer instead of, say, spirits (though that is a pointer); but that they drink such a lot of it before dinner. Officers in the professional regiments were expected to be fully sober and rational at their evening meal. The real drinking came after. Charles goes on to say that he regularly drank three glasses of gin before dinner : no doubt he felt that this amount did not endanger his sobriety.</p>

        <p><strong>11-12 (5-6) Here my last love died … a moment of folly.</strong> <br />
            This large paragraph is a vast conceit comparing Charles’s diminution of respect for the Army with a man’s loss of love for his wife. Charles’s one marriage will be to Celia : and so if we wish we can see something of the progress of that relationship in these cold words. They give an interesting and eye-opening revelation of a woman whom otherwise we should think of as utterly self-possessed and resolute in the pursuit of her husband’s welfare.</p>

        <p><strong>11 (5) reveille</strong> <br />
            The call to rise in the mornings, given by a bugler. It was the not the first call of the day : the Rouse would have awakened them a quarter of an hour earlier. You may hear it <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23a5KhFqnC4" target="_blank">here</a>. <br/>
            [<em>Ed. note: Cliffe's website leads to an mp3 download which has not been archived; the second line is taken from that page.</em>]
            </p>

        <p><strong>11 (5) Nissen hut</strong> <br />
            A wartime prefabricated building made out of corrugated steel. Its characteristic shape was of a cylinder cut in half lengthways. It was quick to manufacture and quick to erect.</p>
