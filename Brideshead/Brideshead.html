    <section class="brideshead-section body">
    <p>I have recreated here the extremely enlightening annotations of David Cliffe, whose Evelyn Waugh blog—while still accessible on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160729194152/http://www.abbotshill.freeserve.co.uk/home2.htm" target="_blank">the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine</a>—has been offline since 2016. Since then, Mr. Cliffe's work has been available on<a href="https://bridesheadcompanion.blogspot.com/2017/05/contents.html" target="_blank"> another blog</a> made to house the seemingly abandoned annotations. The creator of this blog does not identify themself; whoever they are, I (along with, I am sure, plenty of other Brideshead readers) owe them a great deal of gratitude for preserving such a wonderful and helpful resource! Let us, lacking a proper name, call them Mr. Casaubon in honor of the obsessive tendancy to collect and organize information, a tendency I also share! Mr. Casaubon's blog is a lovely thing, but it is not infallible; it has a few typographic errors and, more importantly, is still missing some of the information from Cliffe's blog, most notably the entire "Chronology" section. This website is an attempt to present a more complete version of the original Brideshead Companion. Right now I am only focused on the Companion annotations for the British edition of the novel, though perhaps in the future I will also recreate Cliffe's annotations on the American edition and his "The Story of Brideshead Revisited" page, which contains a chapter by chapter summary of the book and appropriate stills taken from the 1981 mini-series.</p>
    <p>This website will also be different from the Mr. Casaubon's blog as it is my goal to greatly increase the number of images and illustrations accompanying the text. The original website includes <em>some</em> images, which Mr. Casaubon duitifully presents in his blog, but there are plenty of annotations pertaining to visual references made by Waugh which get no accompanying image on either Cliffe's website or Mr. Casaubon's blog. I would hazard a guess that this selectiveness was not due to any sense of editorial discrimination on Cliffe's part, but was rather an inevitable restriction caused by the stark technical limits the website faced in the late 90s / early 00s. Indeed, Cliffe goes so far as to ask potential readers of the "Story" page to "please remember that illustrations take longer to download than text, and as these illustrations are generally of good quality, they take even longer than usual." Some of the images even get as large as 600x900—Lord, protect my modem! Operating with no such bandwith restrictions, my goal is to present a fully illustrated edition of Cliffe's annotations. Waugh makes extensive reference to artistic and architectural movements and motifs—along with numerous mentions of specific artists and locations—and being able to visualize these references helps immeasurably in immersing oneself in the richly imagained and, in the 21st century, quite alien world presented in <em>Brideshead Revisited</em>.

    <p>I am still figuring out how to set up comments on this website. In the meantime, I ask anyone with notes, suggestions, questions, missives, polemics, theses, prophetations, or otherwise to contact at me through my email, which can be found at the bottom of the page!
