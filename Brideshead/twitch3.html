        <p><strong>263 (277) I never tired of painting her</strong> <br />
            Under the impetus of love, Charles has clearly moved on from architectural painting to portraiture.</p>

        <p><strong>264 (277) Two Christmasses</strong> <br />
            This neatly informs us that we are now in 1938.</p>

        <p><strong>264 (277) Wellingtonias</strong><span id="cap2"></span><br />
            Americans call these trees Sierra Redwoods or Giant Sequoias. The British botanist John Lindley originally
            named the tree <em>Wellingtonia gigantea</em> and in Britain the name <em>Wellingtonia</em> has been
            retained in honour of the great Duke. Its scientific name since 1939 has been <em>Sequoiadendron
                giganteum</em>. Giant Sequoias can grow to a height of 300 feet, though not yet in Britain, where the
            first ones planted are still 250 years from maturity.</p>

        <p><strong>264 (278) Carlsbad plums</strong> <br />
            Preserved plums or damsons, a winter dessert. They are a delicacy originally from a city now called Karlovy
            Vary (in the Czech Republic). The plums are prepared by being placed in hot syrup until they shrivel and are
            then halved and stuffed into larger dried damsons. They are usually sold packed into wooden boxes.They are
            famously gluey and sticky.</p>

        <p><strong>265 (278) Coronation Week</strong> <br />
            George VI, on succeeding his brother Edward VIII on the latter’s abdication, simply took over his
            predecessor’s coronation arrangements, which duly went ahead on 12th May 1937.</p>

        <p><strong>267 (281) smoking suit</strong><span id="cap3"></span><br />
            It was common in the 1920’s and 1930’s for the host to appear in a smoking jacket while all his male guests
            wore white tie and tails or dinner jackets. One assumes the smoking jacket was not in an objectionably dirty
            and smelly state.</p>

    <p><strong>267 (281) Knight of Malta</strong> <br />
        A member of a Catholic order, once military, whose purpose is now ceremonial and charitable. The order, known in 1936 as the Knights Hospitaller of Saint John of Jerusalem, has a distinguished history. The knights originally operated in the Holy Land in the Middle Ages to look after sick pilgrims (in the Hospital of St. John, in Jerusalem), but soon felt compelled to defend the Holy Places and added the waging of war on Islam to their aims. From 1309 they lived in Rhodes and there put up a noble defence against the assaults of the Ottoman Turks. They were finally expelled, but their bravery led the emperor Charles V to grant them the islands of Malta in fief. Their greatest feat was the successful defence of Malta in 1565, marking a turning point in the advance of the Turks in the Mediterranean. After a long period of knightly decay, Napoleon invaded the island in 1798 and encountered no resistance. He then banished the Knights from Malta. After some time they went to Rome where they transformed themselves into a somewhat effete aristocratic body though they retained residual sovereign powers. </p>
    
    <p><strong>268 (281) his dining club</strong> <br />
        EW’s brother Alec Waugh explains this reference in his volume of character sketches <a class="link" href="https://archive.org/details/mybrotherevelyno0000unse_g8s7/page/248/mode/2up" target="_blank"><em>My Brother Evelyn and Other Portraits</em></a>, in the chapter about Vyvyan Holland. In London there were a large number of dining clubs for gentlemen (rarely ladies) where men of like mind or interest could meet for a formal dinner and the presentation of a paper, perhaps half an hour’s worth, by one of their members on a topic in which that member had expertise. The club Alec Waugh is thinking of, called <em>Ye Sette of Odde Volumes</em>, was the oldest of the lot, having been founded in the 1870’s. Its members were not just (indeed infrequently) literary. The rules provided a ponderously humorous background to the proceedings, the President, for example, being addressed as <em>Your Oddship</em>. Officers wore elaborate chains of office. Guests were ceremoniously insulted in the speeches, and on Ladies’ Nights, when wives were invited, the women were introduced with ‘heavy-handed facetiousness’.</p>
    
    <p><strong>269 (282) The Flying Scotsman</strong> <br />
        The name of an express train which ran between London and Edinburgh for more than forty years, or rather of its locomotive.</p>
    
    <p><strong>269 (282) The Charge of the Light Brigade</strong> <br />
        See my note to the Battle of Balaclava on <a class="link" href="prologue.html#Balaclava">page 15</a>.</p>
    
    <p><strong>269 (282) Henley Regatta</strong> <br />
        The Royal Regatta consists of two weeks of rowing competition held in early July on the Thames at Henley, an Oxfordshire town, and is a must for many habitués of the London season.</p>
    
    <p><strong>269 (282) Macbeth</strong> <br />
        The leading character of Shakespeare’s <a class="link" href="https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/macbeth/read/" target="_blank">play</a> of the same name.</p>
    
    <p><strong>269 (282) news from Central Europe</strong> <br />
        This is the period leading up to the Munich Agreement in September 1938. German threats and manufactured complaints against Czechoslovakia were mounting throughout the year.</p>
    
    <p><strong>269 (283) diamond fender</strong> <br />
        Julia no doubt finds this tiara a tiresomely massive object, especially as no dictionary I have consulted defines <em>fender</em> as a type of head-dress. One sometimes sees pictures of Victorian ladies in formal dress wearing a tall, heavy tiara of the type suggested by Julia’s words.</p>

        <p>[<em>Ed. Note: The following annotation does not appear in Cliffe's original.</em>] <br>
            <strong>Beryl</strong> <br />
            Waugh, in both his comic and tragic novels, always had a knack for amusing character names (think of Lord Tangent in <em>Decline and Fall</em>: the poor son of the Duke of Circumferance whose tragic story is only tangential to the main plot) and so I do not think it a stretch to hear Bridey's widowed bride's name as a homophonic play on the word "barrel", aurally reflecting her apparent heft.
        </p>
    
    <p><strong>270 (284) Falmouth Town Library</strong> <br />
        Falmouth is a delightful Cornish resort, though in earlier centuries it had been a thriving international seaport. It is not well known that Falmouth was a centre of phillumeny.</p>
    
    <p><strong>271 (284) Catholic Players’ Guild</strong> <br />
        Catholic representation in the acting profession has always been strong. This organisation caters for their spiritual and communal needs, and still exists today.</p>
    
    <p><strong>272 (284) in no case would Beryl consent to be your guest</strong> <br />
        This embargo would have been almost as remarkable in 1938 as it appears to us now, even among strict Catholics. One immediately wonders whether the scruple is Mrs Muspratt’s or Bridey’s. Julia later comes to the opinion that Beryl is ‘madly tough’ and the scruples are all Bridey’s.</p>
    
    <p id="Catechism"><strong>273 (286) they bought it for a penny at the church door.</strong> <br />
        A reference to the Penny Catechism, which at the time did cost one penny to buy. It was published by the Catholic Truth Society and fitted into one’s jacket pocket. It elucidated the truths of the faith for ordinary people by a process of question and answer. As an example the first question was <em>Who made me?</em> and the answer was <em>God made me</em>.</p>
    
    <p><strong>273 (287) living in sin</strong> <br />
        What Julia has realised is that she is responsible for the way her life has gone and for the fact that she has taken no steps to redeem it. Her entire existence is coloured by her acceptance of a sinful condition. What she later goes on to realise (and it may be subconsciously present in this scene) is that marriage with Charles would just contribute to that life of sin and indeed deepen it : in the eyes of God he is after all married to Celia and father to two children for whom he culpably takes no obvious responsibility beyond paying for their education.</p>
    
    <p><strong>287 a tablet of Dial</strong> [<em>Only in Am. Ed.</em>]<br />
        A sleeping tablet of the time. It was a barbiturate, actually allobarbital or 5,5-Diallylbarbituric acid. It was a white crystalline powder compressed into tablet form. EW himself used it extensively. It was withdrawn from the open market in many countries owing to its addictive properties, but is still occasionally used under strict supervision.</p>
    
    <p><strong>274 (288) Christ dying with it</strong> <br />
        Julia is well-versed in Catholic theology. She is referring to Christ’s self-sacrifice on the first Good Friday, bearing all the sins of the world and so redeeming the whole of humanity. Because she maintains a state of sin Julia is adding to the suffering of Christ on the Cross.</p>
    
    <p><strong>274 (288) always the midday sun and the dice clicking</strong> <br />
        Julia’s imagination has really got going here. Christ of course did not physically suffer for eternity : in fact his crucifixion lasted a remarkably short time as these things go. Suffering and sin do continue, however, but Christ’s redemptive act on the cross is valid for ever and for all people, if they will accept him.</p>
    
        <p> The reference to dice is a memory of the gospel account where the soldiers gambled to see which of them would win Christ’s robe. (<a class="link" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019%3A23-24&version=NKJV" target="_blank"><em>Gospel of Saint John</em></a> 19, 23-24)</p>

    <p><strong>274 (288) No way back</strong> <br />
        Julia imagines that, as her life stands at present, she is barred from eternal happiness. This is the full Catholic belief in its massive clarity. What is needed now is amendment.</p>
    
    <p><strong>274 (288) lupus</strong> <br />
        Probably lupus vulgaris hypertrophicus, or tuberculosis of the skin, which destroys the tissues. A very disturbing image to mark her self-loathing.</p>
    
    <p><strong>275 (289) Barton Street</strong> <br />
        A street in London near Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. Bridey obviously has an apartment there now that Marchmain House no longer exists.</p>
    
    <p><strong>276 (290) coffin stools</strong><span id="cap4"></span><br />
        Originally these were a kind of antique bench or joint stool characteristic of the 16th to 18th centuries. An apron in front gave the coffin effect, but in more modern times a coffin stool is simply a piece of furniture with a rectangular top, turned legs and square stretchers. It is probable that they got their name originally because they could be used for resting coffins on.</p>

    <p><strong>276 (290) Holman Hunt’s … ‘The Awakened Conscience’</strong><span id="cap5"></span><br />
        William Holman Hunt (1827-1910), together with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais, founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848. He married successively two sisters named Waugh, cousins of EW’s father. EW considered writing his biography, but the project came to nothing. He did write about Holman Hunt in his biography of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and gave special praise to this painting - he calls it <em>singularly beautiful</em>.</p>
    
        <p>The painting is actually called <em>The Awakening Conscience</em> and can be seen in Tate Britain, London. It shows a woman sitting on the lap of her lover and beginning to rise in the dawning realisation of the folly, immorality and subservience of her position. It became a favourite moral painting of the Victorian period though there was much furore at first.</p>

    <p><strong>276 (290) <em>Pre-Raphaelitism</em></strong> <br />
        John Ruskin (1819-1900) was a supporter and energiser of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Ruskin’s book <a class="link" href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Pre-Raphaelitism" target="_blank"><em>Pre-Raphaelitism</em></a>, in which he described the aims and defended the methods and results of the painters of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, was published in 1851. As the painting <em>The Awakening Conscience</em> was not completed until 1853, it seems that Charles must have got hold of an edition that also included extracts from later letters and writings.</p>
    
    <p><strong>276 (290) Ruskin’s description</strong> <br />
        Ruskin also defended Holman Hunt’s painting in a famous <a class="link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/49508/49508-h/49508-h.htm#page_071" target="_blank">letter</a> to <em>The Times</em> (25 May 1854) in which he wrote, <em>There is not a single object in all that room, common, modern, vulgar (in the vulgar sense, as it may be), but it became tragical, if rightly read</em>. He points out some of the many symbols the painter puts into the picture, including the cat with a struggling bird just dropped from its mouth; the music on the piano that the man is idly playing (Thomas Moore’s <a class="link" href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44782/oft-in-the-stilly-night-scotch-air" target="_blank"><em>Oft, in the Stilly Night</em></a>), the words of which have perhaps startled the woman into recognising the truth of her situation; the furniture with its <em>fatal newness</em>; the tapestry, with its depiction of the fowls of the air feeding on the ripened corn; and the picture above the fireplace <em>with its single drooping figure – the woman taken in adultery</em>.</p>
    
    <p><strong>276 (290) Last Trump</strong> <br />
        The sound of the trumpet calling on all the dead to rise for the Last Judgment. Julia is thinking of the looming threat of World War II, which has occupied her thoughts recently.</p>
    
    <p><strong>276 (291) All I can hope to do is to put my life in some order in a human way</strong> <br />
        Julia, recovered from what she calls hysteria but was in fact an awful apprehension of the truth, settles for what she can get here and now. It may involve defiance of God, but perhaps she can salvage something by having a loving relationship and a child.</p>
    
    <p><strong>271 (291) the setting of a comedy</strong> <br />
        Charles is thinking perhaps of the Restoration comedies of Congreve, Vanbrugh or Farquhar, the plays of Beaumarchais or possibly the elegant dramas of Goldoni. His inability to engage seriously with Julia’s emotions awakens her ire.</p>
    
    <p><strong>278 (293) pack-horses on the Pilgrim’s Way</strong> <br />
        According to Hilaire Belloc, who appears to have invented the route, the Pilgrims’ Way ran from Winchester to Canterbury. The more usual and obvious route was from London to Canterbury, as described by Chaucer. Throughout the later Middle Ages (after the death of Saint Thomas Becket in 1170) there was continual movement along this road. Pilgrims gathered in bands as a form of safeguard against attack by bandits. The packhorses would have carried, amongst other things, valuable gifts for the shrine of the saint at Canterbury.</p>
    
        <p> Charles’s point is that the prayers have remained unchanged while the language has developed so much that few people today could understand speech from Chaucer’s time.</p>
    
    <em>Rex’s associates indulge in a second spate of unintelligent comments on the current political situation, two years after we first heard them.</em>

    <p><strong>278 (293) They won’t fight.</strong> <br />
        This is clearly meant to be the Germans, who are later said to be afraid of the French and the Czechs. The opinion of Rex’s friends, that Britain and France should go to war in 1938, has at least got some credibility, whatever the value of their judgment of the Germans.</p>
    
    <p><strong>279 (293) wolfram … tungsten … manganese … chrome</strong> <br />
        These metals are fondly imagined to be vital for the heavy industries. Unfortunately the Germans had a sufficient amount of them or else found good substitutes. (<em>Wolfram</em> is in fact an earlier name for tungsten.)</p>
    
    <p><strong>279 (293) scared of the Czechs</strong> <br />
        These snippets, dating from a month or two before the Munich Agreement, show that people thought it was still possible that the Czech army would put up a fight against the threatened German invasion.</p>
    
    <p><strong>279 (293) Black Forest</strong> <br />
        A wooded and mountainous region in south-western Germany not far from the border with France.</p>
    
    <p><strong>279 (293) They haven’t the tools …</strong> <br />
        This self-comforting blindness to reality is breathtaking. The list of German deficiencies grows more improbable and fictional as the men proceed.</p>
    
    <p><strong>279 (294) consumption</strong> <br />
        Then still a common name for tuberculosis of the lungs.</p>
    
    <p><strong>279 (294) Goering … Goebbels … Ribbentrop</strong> <br />
        leading men in the Nazi government of Germany. Hermann Goering (1893-1946) was the second-in-command to Hitler and in charge of the Air Force. Joseph Goebbels (1897-1945) was Hitler’s Minister for Propaganda and Enlightenment. Joachim von Ribbentrop (1893-1946) had been the German Ambassador to Britain but in 1938 was appointed Foreign Minister.</p>
    
    <p id="Chamberlain"><strong>280 (294) Chamberlain</strong> <br />
        Neville Chamberlain (1869-1940) was at this time Prime Minister. He was soon to be responsible for negotiating the Munich Agreement which famously betrayed the Czech people and government, though within a year he was to have the unpleasant task of declaring war on Germany.</p>
    
    <p id="Halifax"><strong>280 (294) Halifax</strong> <br />
        Edward Frederick Lindley Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax (1881-1959), was appointed secretary of state for foreign affairs early in 1938 and played an important role in the negotiation of the Munich Agreement. He might have succeeded Chamberlain as Prime Minister in 1940 instead of Churchill, with the probability that he would have sued for peace. The fact that Halifax was a member of the House of Lords was a decisive factor in ensuring Churchill’s succession; the last Lord who had been Prime Minister, the Marquess of Salisbury, had resigned in 1902, and there was a general feeling that there should not be another.</p>
    
    <p><strong>280 (294) Sir Samuel Hoare</strong> <br />
        British politician (1880-1959) who was Foreign Secretary for a few months in 1935. He developed with Pierre Laval of France the so-called Hoare-Laval Plan for the partition of Abyssinian land between Italy and Abyssinia. The proposal was widely denounced, and Hoare was forced to resign. By 1938 he was back in government as Home Secretary in Chamberlain’s National Government.</p>
    
    <p><strong>280 (294) 1922 Committee</strong> [<em>Ed. Note: "1920 Committee in the Am. Ed.</em>]<br />
        All the Conservative Party backbenchers in the House of Commons (and so not including any government ministers) are members of this committee. Rex’s friends are clearly in a minority.</p>
    
    <p><strong>280 (294) Peace Pledge</strong> <br />
        In the mid-thirties a strong peace movement developed in Britain which was strengthened by a ballot organised in 1935 by the British League of Nations Union. A great majority of those who voted supported the policy of “collective security”. The following year, the British Peace Pledge Union was announced, a pacifist movement opposed to the Spanish Civil War and, especially, to the view that fascism in Europe could only be stopped by war. It issued Peace Pledge cards on which supporters signed the statement <em>I renounce war, and I will never support or sanction another</em>. The movement was more influential than perhaps was realised at the time since it reinforced the government’s policy of appeasement.</p>
    
    <p><strong>280 (294) Foreign Office</strong> <br />
        Those outside the system have often believed that Foreign Office diplomats and officials have worked to their own agenda and for their own or their department’s good rather than for the country’s.</p>
    
    <p><strong>280 (294) New York Banks</strong> <br />
        These too, it was considered, had always worked for their own advantage and for no other good. Their power was more and more resented in Europe in this period as loans and investment increased their influence. On top of this, the US government encouraged foreign trade in the late 30’s by the creation of export-import banks through which the government made loans to firms intending to increase their sales in foreign countries. This was considered unfair competition by other trading countries.</p>
    
    <p><strong>280 (294) a rubber</strong> <br />
        i.e. of bridge, then a favourite pastime. Contract bridge had entirely replaced auction bridge by 1938. A rubber is a match of three or five deals.</p>
    
    <p><strong>280 (295) Trojan walls … Grecian tents … Cressid</strong> <br />
        The walls of Troy helped the Trojans to resist the Greek siege for ten years. Cressid (Cressida in Shakespeare, Criseyde in Chaucer) was a Trojan girl who was loved by Prince Troilus but when in the hands of the Greeks fell in love with her seducer Diomedes. Troilus gets killed soon after (in Shakespeare’s play) or survives to witness her degradation without recognising her (in Chaucer’s poem). Her story is lamentable because she is an innocent, manipulated girl of simple affections who is out of her depth.</p>
    
        <p> The whole of the closing passage of this chapter (which has Shakespearean echoes) is saturated with a sense of impermanent and fragile happiness : the Trojan walls will not hold out for ever, illusions will be destroyed, true love will be shattered, and the real world of violence will break in. World War II is just over twelve months away.</p>
