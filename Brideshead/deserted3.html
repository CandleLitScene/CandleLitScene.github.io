        <p><strong>193 (200) General Strike</strong> <br />
            A national strike of British trades union members in key industries from 4th to 12th May 1926. The Trades Union Congress, an organisation of all the major trades unions in the country, called it in support of miners who were resisting the imposition of lower pay and longer hours. The government, however, was prepared for it and called out troops and volunteers to distribute food and keep services running. Charles becomes one of those volunteers, some of whom, on doubtful authority, exercised a coercive discipline. The T.U.C. decided to stop the strike after only nine days because its members were horrified at the prospect of violence, and because the miners were unwilling to moderate their demands in any way and so blocked any compromise.</p>
        
        <p><strong>193 (201) Futurist</strong> <br />
            An adherent of Futurism, an early 20th-century movement in art that rejected all tradition and instead glorified contemporary life, especially machines. Many of its artists (e.g. Giacomo Balla, 1871-1958) tried to capture the effect of motion in their works. Futurism at its peak lasted only a few years and by 1926 had been overtaken by other movements, especially surrealism.</p>

        <p><strong>194 (201) all parts of Europe</strong> <br />
            At the end of World War I, the regimes of many countries in central and eastern Europe collapsed. Syndicalist or communist revolutions ensued on a more or less large scale and were opposed by government or counter-revolutionary action. The whole era was characterised by violence and confusion, though by 1926 stability was returning or being imposed in most of Europe.</p>
        
        <p><strong>194 (201) mud of Flanders ... flies of Mesopotamia</strong> <br />
            These are two of the war zones of World War I familiar to the British public. Flanders is in northern France and Belgium, where rain could result in vast paddy fields of almost impassable mud. They had a reputation for horror because wounded men often drowned in them; the mud was sometimes waist-high. Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) is where British forces fought Turks in desert conditions often of extreme heat.</p>
        
        <p><strong>194 (202) <em>garçonniére</em> ... Auteuil</strong> <br />
            An apartment in one of the fashionable suburbs of west Paris near the racecourse. A garçonnière was originally a place, often an attic, where the boys slept, supposedly safely away from the girls. In modern times it is an apartment generally for one person (usually a bachelor). The fact that the girls are living in one can be taken as an assertion of sexual equality.</p>
        
        <p><strong>194 (202) Café Royal</strong> <br />
            A famous restaurant in Regent Street in London, just by Piccadilly.</p>
        
            [<em>Ed. Note: After closing in 2008, the Café Royal reopened in 2012 under the same name as an upscale hotel.</em>]

        <p><strong>194 (202) one group, from Cambridge</strong> <br />
            The Oxford men may seem to be supporting the government and employers, the Cambridge men the strikers. In reality it was not like that - university men flocked to both sides from either place. EW, having been at Oxford himself, likes to have the Oxford men doing what he approves. He himself became a special constable during the General Strike, and was appalled by the poor quality of his fellow-guardians of public order.</p>
        
        <p><strong>194 (202) Transport House</strong> <br />
            The headquarters of the Transport and General Workers’ Union, and also of the Labour Party. The strike was co-ordinated from here.</p>
        
        <p><strong>195 (202) Budapest ... Horthy</strong> <br />
            Admiral Miklós Horthy (1868-1957) had a distinguished career in World War I and was asked by the anti-Communist parties in 1919 to organise resistance to the Communist coup in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. He won the consequent civil war within a year. He went on to be Regent of Hungary until 1944.</p>
        
        <p><strong>195 (202) 'Black Birds'</strong> <br />
            A London review by a black American group was named <em>Blackbirds of 1926</em>. Its company was led by Florence Mills, who had already made a great name for herself in London in 1923 in the musical <em>Dover Street to Dixie</em>. The popularity of American jazz bands and singing groups increased enormously in the 1920’s, especially with the easy availability of records. Many of these groups crossed the Atlantic.</p>

            [<em>Ed. Note: For further reading on the cultural exchange between American Jazz music and British popular culture through the lens of </em>Dover Street to Dixie<em> see the book chapter <a class="link" href="https://research.gold.ac.uk/id/eprint/24400/1/London_Berlin2-9.pdf" target="_blank"></em>Dover Street to Dixie and the Politics of Cultural Transfer
                and Exchange</a><em>; the chapter also touches on some of the same themes of decline as Waugh does in </em>Brideshead.]
        
        <p><strong>195 (202) Bricktop's ... Bal Nègre in Rue Blomet</strong> <br />
            Nightclubs in Paris specialising in cabaret. <em>Bricktop</em> was the nickname of the club’s founder, Ada Smith (1894-1984). <em>Bal Nègre</em> was the name of a 1927 review starring Josephine Baker (1905-1975) which inspired a famous poster; the club became famous for its promotion of the beguine.</p>

        <p><strong>195 (203) Belgrave Square</strong> <br />
            The very centre of high society’s residential area in London (‘Belgravia’).</p>
        
        <p><strong>196 (203) Lesley and Roberts</strong> <br />
            Fashionable tailors in Hanover Square. The Oxford aesthetes employed them to make wasp-waisted suits, according to Cyril Connolly.</p>
        
        <p><strong>196 (203) Nada Alopov ... Jean Luxmore</strong> <br />
            I have not identified these characters. I imagine they are fictional though EW may have based them on real people whom some of his readers might have been able to identify. In the first edition it is made clear by the punctuation (a semi-colon after <em>Alopov</em> ) that Jean Luxmore and all the others had visited Nada Alopov.</p>
        
            <p>There has been some interest aroused by Blanche’s mentioning that Nada Alopov was <em>quite the best man</em>. Best man for what? Judging from the context it seems to mean, the best man for intoxicating Sebastian. Some commentators therefore think that Alopov was an experienced male prostitute. He might equally easily be a drug-dealer - his having thug friends might suggest drugs more readily.</p>

        <p><strong>196 (203) Regina Bar</strong> <br />
        A popular spot to meet at in Marseilles, though I have not identified where it was.</p>
        
        [<em>Ed. Note: There is one other reference I can find to a "Regina Bar" in Marseille, though its connection to Waugh does not readily present itself. The Greek poet and sailor Nikos Kavvadias (1910–1975), in the fifth verse of the poem "<a class="link" href="https://lyricstranslate.com/en/%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%82-%CE%BD%CE%AD%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82-%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%83%CF%84%CE%AE%CF%82-%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C-%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%84%CE%B6%CE%B9%CE%BC%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%84%CE%AF-black-stoker-dji.html" target="_blank"></a></em>A Black Stoker From Djibouti<em>" from his 1933 collection </em><a class="link" href="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/nikos_kabbadias/1933_marampoy_home.htm" target="_blank">Marabou</a><em>, mentions a bar with the same name:</p>

            <p></p><div style="margin-left: 50px;"></em>
                Inside his huge body he had an innocent heart <br />
                One evening inside Regina bar in Marseille <br />
                In order to protect me from a Spaniard <br />
                He took a blow on the head with an empty bottle <br />
            </div></p>
        
        <p><em>I can find no connection between Kavvadias and Waugh. Kavvadias' bar is frequented by drug users and dealers, including the Willie who defends the poet, so if such a bar did exist it is reasonable it is the same den of illegal drugs that Sebastian haunts to meet with the drug-dealing Nada Alopov.</em>]</p>

        <p><strong>196 (204) s-s-stumer</strong> <br />
            a worthless cheque</p>
        
        <p><strong>196 (204) Tangier</strong> <br />
            A city on the Moroccan coast, since 1923 an international city with its permanent security provided for by Great Britain, France, and Spain.</p>
        
        <p><strong>196 (204) footman in <em>Warning Shadows</em> </strong> <br />
            A character in a German silent film (German title <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57W5Wl6iIYc" target="_blank"><em>Schatten</em></a>, 1923), directed by Arthur Robison, which was both popular and very influential (on Alfred Hitchcock, for one). It starred Fritz Kortner and Ruth Weyher. EW saw it in November 1924 and thought it ‘quite superb’.</p>
        
        <p><strong>196 (204) Foreign Legion</strong> <br />
        A unit of the French army consisting of volunteers of other nationalities, in 1926 based in Algeria. It could be sent anywhere in the world to protect French interests. Its regimen is famously tough.</p>
        
        <p><strong>196 (204) Kasbah</strong> <br />
            The older part of a north African city where the markets are found.</p>
        
        <p><strong>197 (204) Florence Mills</strong> <br />
            (1896-1927), African-American singer and dancer, one of the most famous black entertainers of the Jazz Age. There appear to be extant no film of her dancing (which was admired in all circles, including ballet) and no recording of her singing, with the result that her status as the first great black female entertainer is unappreciated today. She was nicknamed Blackbird from her signature song I’m a Little Blackbird Looking for a Bluebird. During her stay in Europe she became seriously ill, returned to New York and died following an operation for appendicitis. 150,000 people reputedly attended her funeral.</p>
        
        <p><strong>198 (205) 'Like Australians'</strong> <br />
            Charles and Mulcaster are undoubtedly thinking of the large number of Australian soldiers who died in the unsuccessful Gallipoli campaign (1915) in World War I.</p>
        
        <p><strong>198 (206) Commercial Road</strong> <br />
            A main road into London from the east. It is therefore in the East End, a working-class area where sympathy for the strike was strong.</p>
        
        <p><strong>199 (207) Camden Town</strong> <br />
            A district in London, then a working-class area but now gentrified.</p>
        
        <p><strong>199 (207) bandanna</strong> <br />
            A large square of brightly coloured cotton or silk cloth which can be worn over the hair or around the neck. Sir Adrian uses his for a handkerchief.</p>
        
        <p><strong>200 (207) Hansard</strong> <br />
            The official (and supposedly) verbatim account of the debates in the Houses of Parliament. The clerks are usually gracious enough to tidy up the realities of the speeches.</p>
