        <em>My cousin Jasper’s Grand Remonstrance - a warning against charm - Sunday morning in Oxford</em>

        <p><strong>41 (40) Grand Remonstrance</strong> <br />
            This term comes from English history. A remonstrance takes the form of a protest and a demand for reform.
            The original Grand Remonstrance debates took place in 1640-1 when the leaders of the Long Parliament
            prepared a catalogue of their grievances against King Charles I. It signalled the imminent outbreak of the
            English Civil Wars since for the first time members of the House of Commons began to form into opposing
            parties of royalists and parliamentarians.</p>

        <p><strong>41 (40) schools ... History Previous</strong> <br />
            <em>Schools</em> is the university term for <em>examinations</em>.
        </p>
        <p>There is some confusion resulting from this sentence. We know that Charles met Sebastian in his third term
            since matriculation (page 26) and that, as one would expect, this was the summer term. History Previous was
            the first examination the students would take for the History School, but it was taken at the end of the
            second (the spring) term, not the third term. EW has obviously forgotten this fact, or he may have been
            confused by the fact that, unusually, he himself began his university career in the second term, the Hilary
            Term. I have not yet ascertained whether he therefore took his History Previous examination at the end of
            the summer, the Trinity, term, but it seems likely.</p>

        <p><strong>41 (40) subfusc</strong><span id="cap1"></span><br />
            <em>Subfusc</em> means <em>dark</em>, but in this context actually indicates <em>black</em>. Students were
            always required to wear subfusc academic dress (that is, black suit, white bow-tie and white shirt) for
            their examinations, for example.

        <p><strong>41 (40) Pindar’s Orphism</strong> <br />
            Pindar was a Greek lyric poet of the fifth century B.C. </p>
        <p>Orpheus was the greatest musician in ancient Greek mythology. A religion developed in Greece supposedly based
            on the teachings and songs of Orpheus which certainly became influential by Pindar’s time. In the Orphic
            religion, the physical body was understood to be a prison for the essence of a person, which could be
            released when a state of ecstasy was achieved. Jasper has presumably been examined on the extent to which
            Pindar’s <a class="link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/3650" target="_blank">choral odes</a>
            were influenced by Orphic ritual and religious ideas.</p>

        <p><strong>42 (41) O.S.C.U.</strong> <br />
            Oxford Student Christian Union, an evangelical group.</p>

        <p><strong>42 (41) hop-pickers</strong> <br />
            Hops are used to flavour beer. They are ready for harvest in August, and because the harvesting then was
            very labour-intensive, vast numbers of the poorer Londoners combined work with a holiday by coming into the
            countryside for three to six weeks to pick the hops, particularly in Kent. This practice has now all but
            ceased since machines do the job faster and better.</p>

        <p><strong>42 (41) long vac.</strong> <br />
            i.e. long vacation, the summer holiday which lasts from late June to early October.</p>

        <p><strong>42 (41) Yeomanry</strong> <br />
            A regiment of cavalry raised from a defined area (usually a county), obviously from among people who were
            rich enough to own and ride horses. They were therefore a force for conservative strength in the century
            after their first formation in 1761. Some yeomanry regiments were raised specially to go to war in France in
            World War I. Lord Marchmain tells us much later that his own neighbour (Strickland-Venables) was the
            Commanding Officer.</p>

        <p>As we find out later that Brideshead is in Wiltshire, his regiment must be the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry (The
            Prince of Wales’ Own Regiment). In 1884 Queen Victoria allotted to the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry the position
            of Number One in the authorised table of precedence for the several regiments of Yeomanry in Great Britain.
        </p>

        <p>Lord Marchmain mentions a common fate of yeomanry regiments in his long reminiscence towards the end of the
            book; he says that, when he was fifty, his regiment was dismounted and sent into the line. Cavalry regiments
            were of little utility in a war of limited manoeuvre and massive firepower, and indeed they were never
            important afterwards. They were to be transformed into armoured regiments by the time World War II came
            along.</p>

        <p><strong>42 (42) divorce</strong> <br />
            As today, the Catholic Church did not give divorces. Occasionally annulments are granted, but they are
            technically declarations that the marriages were invalid from the beginning. Jasper expresses the common
            (and false) opinion that divorces can easily be bought from the church.</p>

        <p><strong>43 (42) stiffer element</strong> <br />
            i.e. the tiresomely manly students, what we might today call the ‘macho men’.</p>

        <p><strong>43 (42) Mercury</strong><span id="cap2"></span><br />
            A fountain in the middle of Tom Quadrangle in Christ Church College. A new statue of Mercury can now be seen
            there, but in 1923 the original had long gone. Nevertheless the unoccupied basin was still called ‘Mercury’.

        <p><strong>43 (42) Partagas</strong> <br />
            One of the best cigars, first created in Cuba in 1845 by Jaime Partagas. From 1900 the firm was run by the
            Cifuentes family, who became the best-known cigar makers in Cuba and therefore the world. EW loved their
            cigars, especially the classic Lusitania model. In 1961 Ramon Cifuentes (1907-2000) left the country when
            the new revolutionary government took over the factories. He eventually combined with the General Cigar
            Company to set up a new Partagas business in the Dominican Republic which attempted, with some limited
            success, to replicate the ancient qualities. The Cubans still make what are called Partagas cigars but many
            doubt that their quality is as high as it was under Cifuentes.</p>

        <p><strong>43 (42) Lalique</strong><span id="cap3"></span><br />
            René Lalique (1860-1945), famous French designer and maker of art nouveau decorative glassware and
            jewellery.</p>

            Oxford University Dramatic Society, a high-powered and respected theatrical group.</p>

        <p><strong>43 (43) Maidenhead</strong> <br />
            A Berkshire town remarkable perhaps for its middle-class solidity, though in the 1920’s it became for a time
            a resort of high society.</p>

        <p><strong>43 (43) glee-singing</strong> <br />
            Aong-singing in three (or more) parts, very popular in Victorian times and still common in 1923. Glees
            developed in the 17th century at least as early as John Playford’s <a class="link"
                href="https://archive.org/details/bim_early-english-books-1641-1700_the-musical-companion-_playford-john_1673/page/n1/mode/2up"
                target="_blank"><em>A Musical Companion</em></a> of 1667 but derived from the ayres of the Elizabethan
            era. They can be distinguished from ayres and ballads only by being wholly light-hearted, i.e. full of glee.
        </p>

        <p><strong>43 (43) garden suburb</strong> <br />
            A small, planned suburb that was intended to combine the amenities of urban life with the ready access to
            nature typical of rural environments. Jasper obviously despises them as artificial.</p>

        <p><strong>44 (43) Ravenna</strong> <br />
            Ancient Roman city in north-eastern Italy near the Adriatic Sea, about 70 miles south of Venice.</p>

        <p><strong>44 (44) <em>S. Nichodemus of Thyatira</em></strong> <br />
            I think this must be the Pharisee Nicodemus, a member of the Sanhedrin, who visited Christ at night to find
            out more about his teaching (<a class="link"
                href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3&version=KJV" target="_blank"><em>Gospel of
                    Saint John 3</em></a>) and then demurred at the attitude of his fellow Pharisees when they took an
            aggressive attitude towards Our Lord (<a class="link"
                href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+7%3A50-52&version=KJV" target="_blank"><em>John
                    7:50-52</em></a>). He helped Joseph of Arimathea by supplying the aloes and myrrh for the burial of
            Christ’s body after the Crucifixion (<a class="link"
                href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+19%3A39&version=KJV" target="_blank"><em>John
                    19:39</em></a>). But I know of no evidence either that he was born in or associated with the Lydian
            town of Thyatira (now in Turkey and called Akhisar) or that he is the patron saint of bald people. He is
            certainly venerated as a martyr, though no facts survive of his martyrdom. And the date of his feast-day
            (then 3rd August but now 31st August) does not fit in with the timing of the Easter vacation.</p>

        <p><strong>45 (44) <em>ear-trumpet</em></strong> <br />
            This detail has a piquancy for students of EW’s life. In old age he liked to proclaim his deafness and carry
            an ear-trumpet around with him that gave him an additional weapon with which to disconcert those he wished
            to keep at a distance.</p>

        <p><strong>45 (44) Byzantine Art</strong> <br />
            The art of the Eastern Roman Empire, a vast subject covering a period from the early fourth to the
            mid-fifteenth centuries. One of EW’s friends from Oxford, Robert Byron, became an expert on this subject but
            the value of his judgment was undermined by his assertion that there was no worthwhile art in western Europe
            from the Middle Ages to the 20th century apart from El Greco’s.</p>

        <p><strong>45 (44) <em>Mausoleum of Galla Placidia</em></strong><span id="cap4"></span><span id="cap5"></span><br />
            Aelia Galla Placidia (390?-450) was the daughter of one Roman Emperor (Theodosius I), the sister of a second
            (Honorius), the wife of a third (Constantius) and the mother of a fourth (Valentinian III). A mausoleum is a
            building designed to contain the tomb of a famous person. Galla Placidia’s mausoleum at Ravenna is a
            triumphant example of Romanesque architecture but its chief claim to fame is the mosaics inside, one of
            which presents Christ as the Good Shepherd for the first time in art history.</p>

        <p><strong>45 (44) All Souls</strong> <br />
            All Souls is the only college in Oxford which has no undergraduates. All scholars are therefore first-class
            graduates. Every year graduates compete for two fellowships of seven years’ duration, which may be extended.
            In ‘a year of hot competition’ even very good candidates would fail to get a place. There are also elected
            fellowships awarded to prominent people virtually for life and visiting fellowships awarded for a short
            period generally to eminent foreigners. Mr Samgrass, who is inflicted on the boys later, is a scholar of All
            Souls.</p>

        <p><strong>46 (45) naughtiness high in the catalogue of grave sins</strong><span id="cap9"></span><br />
            The only reference in BR to the depth of Charles Ryder’s relationship with Sebastian (after all he was
            ‘looking for love’). Some think that the implication is that they were lovers. They argue that grave sins
            are known in the Catholic Church as ‘mortal sins’, and, if unrepented, deserve eternal damnation. Mere
            friendship cannot qualify for such condemnation.</p>

        <p>At that time, and until much later, passionate male friendships were common in British universities because
            of the comparative lack of female companionship. EW himself had at least two such passionate friendships at
            Oxford.</p>

        <p>But it is possible that the relationship between Charles and Sebastian could be considered worthy of
            disapproval though it fell short of full sexual expression. One correspondent has reminded me that the
            drunkenness and self-centred hedonism of the two boys were in themselves grave sin in the theology of St
            Thomas Aquinas, and that this fact may be what Ryder is referring to.</p>

        [<em>Ed. Note: In trying to downplay and simplify the complicated (but clear) homoerotic overtones of Charles
            and Sebastian's relationship, Mr. Cliffe also downplays and simplifies the homoerotic nature of Waugh's
            personal relationships while at Oxford. The first line of the second paragraph of this annotation seems to
            be a paraphrase of two lines found on p. 82 in Martin Stannard's <a class="link"
                href="https://archive.org/details/evelynwaughearly0000stan_p3t5/page/82/mode/2up" target="_blank"></em>
        Evelyn Waugh, the early years 1903-1939<em></a>: "It is too easy in the age of Gay Liberation to misinterpret
            the male domain Oxford represented in the 'twenties. 'Homosexual' friendships were the norm because women
            were rarely admitted to the life of the University." Yet we find, in the same volume, explicit mentions of
            Waugh's own predilections, as on p. 90: "Alec [Waugh], with his ascendant literary reputation and his rugger
            on Saturdays, found the exhibitionist homosexuality, so promenint in [Hypocrites' Club], immature and
            essentially distasteful. Evelyn was at that time passing though an overtly homosexual phase. After [Richard]
            Pares had drifted from him, Waugh had taken up with Alastair Graham and was, once again, passionately
            devoted." It is not my intention on this website to make any extended argument about the nature of Charles
            and Sebastian's relationship; suffice to say, it seems clear enough to me. As much as I appreciate Mr.
            Cliffe's
            notes for their clarity and insight, this is a case where he clearly bends the sources towards his own
            subjective view—notice especially the surreptitious switching of 'homosexual' for 'passionate' in the
            paraphrase. I invite the reader to research Waugh's life and relationships on their own. <br>

            I also suspect the reference to "other, more ancient lore" in the same paragraph as the annotated line is
            another homosexual allusion.</em>]

            William Hogarth (1697-1764) was perhaps the first great English-born painter. In his etchings and paintings
            he revealed with satirical intent the true state of English society. He exposed flaws in all sections of the
            community, which he nevertheless portrays as having an earthy vitality. His page boys are confederates in
            the vice of their employers, usually enablers but sometimes participants.</p>

        <p><strong>47 (46) Jockey Club at Buenos Aires</strong> <br />
            Many countries have Jockey Clubs, of course, all having something to do with horse-racing. The original
            Jockey Club was founded at Newmarket in 1752 in order to form and apply the Rules of Racing and to license
            individuals and racecourses. Its Stewards have disciplinary and coercive authority in British horse-racing.
        </p>

        <p>Many foreign Jockey Clubs followed. The one at Buenos Aires was created in 1882 with the intention of
            founding and managing racing activities, but also with the aim of becoming a social centre for the top set.
            It had its own race-course, and the specially designed headquarters in Florida Street had a magnificent
            facade, splendid rooms and luxurious furnishings. By 1923 the Club was the leading social centre in the
            city.</p>

        <p><em>The names that follow represent the great and good of European artistic life in the 1920’s, especially
                those based in Paris, then the centre of artistic ferment. Anthony Blanche is clearly well acquainted
                with the smartest set. The tone of the relationships that he formed abroad and are now mentioned is
                covertly homoerotic.</em></p>

        [<em>Ed. Note: In case Mr. Cliffe is not explicit enough: these relationships are "covertly homoerotic" because
            all of these men were either gay or bisexual.</em>]

        <p><strong>47 (46) Proust</strong> <br />
            Marcel Proust, the great French novelist (1871-1922), author of <a class="link"

            appeared.</p>

        <p><strong>47 (46) Gide</strong> <br />
            André Gide (1869-1951), French novelist and writer. He was famous for his modern approach to personal
            morality, expressed first in his novel <a class="link"
                href="https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20150505" target="_blank"><em>L'Immoraliste</em></a>
            (1902). In all his novels individuals struggle to express their nature fully, though their actions and
            beliefs may be at odds with society’s prevailing concepts. He was to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in
            1947.</p>

        <p><strong>47 (46) Cocteau</strong> <br />
            Jean Cocteau (1889-1963), French artistic polymath, most famous in 1923 for his poetry and his ballet
            creations.</p>

        <p><strong>47 (46) Diaghilev</strong> <br />
            Sergey Diaghilev (1872-1929), émigré Russian theatrical entrepreneur who founded the Ballets Russes in Paris
            in 1909.</p>

        <p><strong>47 (46) Firbank</strong> <br />
            Ronald Firbank (1886-1926), English novelist whose fantastic and idiosyncratic humour and subtle style of
            writing influenced EW. His novels include <a class="link"

        <p><strong>47 (46) Capri</strong> <br />
            Island at the southern end of the Bay of Naples. By 1923 it was an elite resort. As Capri was the site of
            the Swedish doctor-writer Axel Munthe’s Villa San Michele, Blanche had possibly been visiting him.</p>

        <p><strong>47 (46) Cefalu</strong> <br />
            Ancient town in northern Sicily, then a centre for the occult arts practised by decadent western
            pseudo-intellectuals led by a diabolist named Aleister Crowley (1875-1947). One of EW’s acquaintances died
            there in mysterious circumstances while studying black magic.</p>

        <p><strong>47 (46) cured of drug-taking in California</strong> <br />
            A therapy with a surprisingly modern sound, but already answering a need in 1923.</p>

        <p><strong>47 (46) Oedipus complex</strong> <br />
            Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) introduced this lynchpin of psychoanalytical theory in his book <a class="link"
                href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Interpretation_of_Dreams" target="_blank"><em>The
                    Interpretation of Dreams</em></a> (1899). It postulates a stage which children have to go through in
            which a child feels attraction to the parent of the opposite sex and rivalry towards the one of the same
            sex. Lack of harmonious resolution of the complex would lead to neurotic problems in adult life. By 1923 the
            term was part of the common cant of the chattering classes. Vienna was still the centre of Freud’s practice
            and a magnet for disgruntled and wealthy idlers.</p>

        <p><strong>47 (47) Naples</strong> <br />
            The ancient city in Italy, until the middle of the nineteenth century the capital of a decadent and shabbily
            splendid kingdom. The capering urchins mentioned here are still only too obvious today.</p>

        <p><strong>47 fetishists</strong> [<em>Only in Am. Ed.</em>]<br />
            This sentence, which was cut out of the revised edition of the novel, makes it clear, if it was not clear
            already, that Blanche is knowledgable about unexpressed sexual urges and likes to shock others with his
            knowledge.</p>

        <p><strong>48 (47) Thame</strong><span id="cap11"></span><br />
            A small and pleasant town just over ten miles east of Oxford, pronounced ‘Tame’. The inn Blanche takes
            Charles to is the Spreadeagle, one of EW’s favourite hostelries. From 1922 to 1932 it was run by a
            remarkable eccentric called John Fothergill (1876-1957) whose <a class="link"
                href="https://archive.org/details/innkeepersdiary0000foth/page/n5/mode/2up" target="_blank"><em>An
                    Innkeeper's Diary</em></a> is a fascinating account of his inn-keeping philosophy and his varied
            encounters with customers. EW inscribed a copy of <em>Decline and Fall</em> with the words ‘To John
            Fothergill, Oxford’s only civilising influence’. The Spreadeagle was originally a 16th century private house
            but became a coaching inn after the brick façade was built in the 18th century. The great sign on the
            pavement outside was erected to Fothergill’s own design and the dismay of the local council. It is a notable
            landmark now.</p>

        <p><strong>48 (47) Bullingdon</strong> <br />
            the famous club joined by the hearty rich to dine and drink heavily. It still exists, its members
            distinguished by their blue and white tailcoats. After one of their dinners they frequently find the club
            suspended by the university authorities because of gross behaviour and outrageous vandalism. EW gives a
            thinly disguised account of its activities (under the name of the Bollinger Club) in the opening chapter of
            his novel <em>Decline and Fall</em>.</p>

        <p><strong>48 (47) Rhine wine</strong> <br />
            This German wine was very popular in Britain in Victorian times though one might be surprised to find
            Anthony Blanche proposing to drink it in 1923. Did he judge it as suitable for Charles’s taste? Or is he
            being provocative in maintaining a flagrantly individual preference which is not that of the up-to-date set?
        </p>

        <p><strong>48 (47) J-J-Jorrocks</strong> <br />
            Mr Jorrocks is a character from the tales and novels of Robert Surtees (1803-1864). Jorrocks is a Cockney
            grocer who is celebrated for his bluntness and is entirely devoted to fox hunting. Surtees’s first book was
            entitled <a class="link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15387" target="_blank"><em>Jorrocks' Jaunts
                    and Jollities</em></a> (1831).</p>

        <p><strong>48 (47) Alexandra cocktails</strong> <br />
            To Charles a noxious concoction. An Alexandra cocktail consists of equal parts of Tia Maria, Rum, Cream, and
            Cream of Coconut. Shake with ice and serve. In the American Edition it is misprinted as "Alexander
            cocktails".</p>

        <p><strong>48 (47) sherry</strong> <br />
            Blanche judges sherry to be a conventional drink which is to be avoided. It is odd he did not equally
            discount Rhine wine.</p>

        <p><strong>48 (48) <a class="link" href="https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/60483" target="_blank"><em>Antic
                        Hay</em></a></strong> <br />
            A novel by Aldous Huxley (1894-1963), just published in 1923. It is a witty, malicious satire of the English
            literary world. EW considered it Huxley’s best book; he thought that Huxley declined afterwards. Blanche’s
            judgment of it as ‘forbidding’ is unexpected : it is perhaps a little long.</p>

        <p><strong>48 (48) Garsington</strong> <br />
            Garsington Manor in Oxfordshire was owned by Lady Ottoline Morrell (1873-1938) and her husband Philip. She
            was a hostess and patron of the arts who brought together some of the most important writers and artists of
            her day, including, among others, D.H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley, Bertrand Russell, T.S. Eliot
            and Augustus John. So Blanche is moving in exalted circles. He possibly expects Huxley to be present to
            receive his snub. Garsington Manor is now a centre for the arts, and hosts opera performances.</p>

        <p><strong>48-49 (48) Vichy water</strong> <br />
            A water from the mineral springs at Vichy in central France. It was very popular at this time.</p>

        <p><strong>49 (48) Peckwater</strong><span id="cap12"></span><br />

        <p><strong>49 (48) <em>vieux port</em></strong> <br />
            ‘Old port’ (French), an ancient quarter containing the red light district of Marseilles, the French
            Mediterranean city. It serves as the location where Paul Pennyfeather loses his hat in <em>Decline and
                Fall</em>. Let us assume that Anthony Blanche was there as a tourist studying the architecture.</p>

        <p><strong>49 (48) litany</strong> <br />
            A devotion consisting of alternations of the varied names of God or appropriate saints with (generally
            repetitive) petitions. Blanche is (unconsciously?) setting himself up as god-like.</p>

        <p><strong>48-49 Seen at a distance ... look at Boy Mulcaster.</strong> [<em>Only in Am. Ed.</em>]<br />
            EW changed this description entirely in the revised edition. He omitted all references to degeneracy. In the
            early years of the twentieth century there was considerable discussion of the effects of degeneracy on a
            nation, with much pseudo-science devoted to ways of recognising degenerates and modes of dealing with this
            perceived threat. Hitler and the Nazis were interested in the so-called problem and attempted to solve it in
            their own revolting way. (See my explanation of degeneracy on page 4. EW was clearly ill at ease with this
            passage by the time he came to revise the novel.)</p>

        <p><strong>49 <em>parti</em></strong> [<em>Only in Br. Ed.</em>]<br />
            ‘Party’ (French); ‘a great <em>parti</em>’ means ‘an impressive person’, often with a hint of irony in it.
            Possibly Blanche chooses to use it because Mulcaster is also fat, though in the first edition of the novel
            he is described as <em>lanky</em>. EW changed the description of Mulcaster entirely for the revised edition.
        </p>

        <p><strong>49 (49) le Touquet</strong> <br />
            A town on the north French coast which was a popular resort for fashionable society in the twenties, by 1923
            it was easily reached by aeroplane. The casino was the centre of activity.</p>

        <p><strong>49 (49) old sponge and toady</strong> <br />
            i.e. heavy drinker and servile flatterer.</p>

        <p><strong>49 (49) hobbledehoys</strong> <br />
            Clumsy and oafish young men.</p>

        <p><strong>49 (49) drab</strong> <br />
            i.e. prostitute.</p>

        <p><strong>50 (49) coloured tail-coats</strong> <br />
            i.e. a formal coat which normally is black but here has tails of a coloured cloth to distinguish the wearers
            from other diners and from waiters. (The point of the story of G.K.Chesterton’s <a class="link"

            confused because of the similarity of their dress.)</p>

        <p><strong>50 (49) inverted</strong> <br />
            This term was often used in the early twentieth century for a person who displayed traits supposedly

        <p><strong>50 ecstacy</strong> [<em>Only in Br. Ed.</em>]<br />
            In the first edition of BR, this word is spelt in the accepted manner, <em>ecstasy</em>. I do not know if EW
            changed it or the printers have made a mistake.</p>

        <p><strong>50 (50) libido</strong> <br />
            A word used by Freud to signify the energy associated with sexual urges.</p>

        <p><strong>51 (51) <em>la fatigue du Nord!</em></strong> <br />
            ‘The wearisome quality of the North!’ (French)</p>

        <p><strong>51 (51) hock</strong> <br />
            This is the Rhine wine that Blanche promised Charles. The term comes from one of the Rhineland towns that
            makes and sells the wine, Hochheim (though it is actually on the River Main). The legend is that, after
            sampling it, Queen Victoria said that she liked ‘this hoch ... hoch .... hock.’ The name stuck. Since she
            spoke excellent German the tale is unlikely, to say the least.</p>

        <p><strong>51 (51) Mrs P-p-ponsonby-de-Tomkyns</strong> <br />
            Mrs Ponsonby de Tomkyns was a character created by the novelist and illustrator George du Maurier (the
            author of <a class="link" href="https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/39858" target="_blank"><em>Trilby</em></a>,
            1834-1896) for satirical articles and cartoons which he produced for publication in the magazine
            <em>Punch</em>. She was a caricature of the <em>nouveaux riches</em> who liked to fancy themselves as
            patrons of the arts. She was a young, pretty woman who was nevertheless cunning and deceitful in furthering
            her interests.
        </p>

        <p><strong>51 (51) <em>P-p-punch</em></strong> <br />
            <em>Punch</em> was the weekly humorous magazine published in London. It was at a peak of popularity in the
            1920’s. A very pale successor existed for a brief period around the turn of the twenty-first century as a
            vanity publication.
        </p>

        <p><strong>51 (51) pop</strong> <br />
            twenty-four senior pupils at Eton College who were (and are) the self-perpetuating arbiters of taste and
            conduct. (The number can vary over the years.) Its formal name is the Eton Society. It was founded in 1811
            originally as a debating society which met in a lollipop shop, hence its nickname. Over time its character
            changed from an intellectual to a sporting one and its members assumed disciplinary powers which (moderated
            in harshness) persist to this day.</p>

        <p>The playwright William Douglas Home, who was elected in 1930, describes Pop like this in his autobiography
            <a class="link" href="https://archive.org/details/halftermreport0000will" target="_blank"><em>Half-Term
                    Report</em></a> (1955) : <br />
        <div style="margin-left: 50px;"><em>The boys in Pop make no effort to disguise the fact. They wear bow ties and
                stick-up collars, coloured
                waistcoats of the fiercest hues and of the strangest materials - of velvet, silk or even crêpe de Chine
                -
                sponge-bag trousers, rolled umbrellas, black patent-leather shoes, blue overcoats, spats if they so
                desire,
                and most eccentric of all, large seals on the centre of the top and fore and aft (below and above the
                brim)
                of their top hats. In other words they are a sight, but be it said with all honesty, a not unpleasing
                sight
                - and they are distinguishable from their non-elect colleagues with as much certainty (and probably with
                as
                little justice) as a peacock is distinguished from an owl. They stroll down the High Street at Eton

            Religious orders were in effect expelled from France in the early years of the twentieth century under
            anti-clerical laws promulgated by socialist governments. Blanche rightly implies that Chartreuse was
            inferior when its production was forcibly taken over by a company set up to do it by the French government
            in 1904. Eventually the authorities recognised their failure and allowed the monks to resume their
            life-style. At any time only three of them make the liqueur and only two of those know the recipe, which is
            reputed to contain over 130 ingredients. The secret has consequently never been revealed.</p>

            The features would have been stylised, with long lines and simple, exaggerated features.</p>

        <p><strong>54 (54) Beecham’s Pills</strong> <br />
            A proprietary medicine which aids digestion and regular bowel movements. The pills made a fortune for the
            Beecham family of whom Sir Thomas the conductor was the most famous.</p>

        <p><strong>54 (54) Florentine <em>quattrocento</em> </strong> <br />
            The <em>quattrocento</em> was the fifteenth century (‘the fourteen-hundreds’). Florence was the prime centre
            of the movements in art and thought which we call the Italian Renaissance.</p>

        <p><strong>54 (54) greenery-yallery</strong> <br />
            i.e. green and yellow. <br />
            In 1877 the Grosvenor Gallery opened in Bond Street, London. The rooms were decorated in green and gold,
            which seemed a wishy-washy background to a Victorian clientele expecting sumptuousness. Sir Edward
            Burne-Jones (1833-1898) sent several esteemed pictures to the opening. Their late Pre-Raphaelite figures
            encouraged the fashion-conscious to dress in styles suggested by both the paintings and the decor, namely a
            willowy look, long costumes (often curiously embroidered) and pastel tints. The aesthetes, led by Oscar
            Wilde, took up this style and liked to appear in public carrying colour-coordinated flowers (especially
            carnations that had been dyed green, sunflowers and lilies). There was an accompanying fashion for tasteful
            yellows, greens and pastel tints in interior decoration. These fads led to the use of the term
            ‘greenery-yallery’.</p>

        <p>There is no doubt that in circles which knew about such things the term became synonymous with homosexual.
            W.S. Gilbert mocked the aesthetes in <a class="link" href="https://gsarchive.net/patience/html/index.html"
                target="_blank"><em>Patience</em></a> (1881) : <br />

        </p>

        <p><strong>54 (54) gay</strong> <br />
            This word did not have its modern meaning of ‘homosexual’ until well into the second half of the twentieth
            century, though its origins lie at least as early as the film <a class="link"
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQDbDIz1Y0E" target="_blank"><em>Bringing Up Baby</em></a> (1938).
            The term ‘bachelor gay’ is much older but did not at first have a homosexual connotation. The loss of the
            word <em>gay</em> deprives English of a specific meaning somewhere between ‘happy’ and ‘merry’, with a
            special light-heartedness added. EW of course has this earlier meaning in mind.</p>

        <p><strong>54 (54) Inquisition</strong> <br />
            Undoubtedly Anthony Blanche is referring to the Spanish Inquisition, which was as much an agent of the state
            as it was a branch of the Church. Its consequently unbridled powers of torture and confiscation made it
            feared throughout the country and abominated throughout Europe. It is intriguing that we are introduced to
            Julia in this horrifying manner. Quite what it is Blanche has against her, other than that she is beautiful
            and a woman, is not clear.</p>

        <p><strong>54 (54) magnifico</strong> <br />
            A person of importance (originally a nobleman of Venice).</p>

        <p><strong>54 (54) Byronic</strong> <br />
            In the brooding, passionate pattern set by George Gordon, Lord Byron (1788-1824), i.e. ‘mad, bad, and
            dangerous to know’ (Lady Caroline Lamb).</p>

        <p><strong>54 (55) Reinhardt nun</strong> <br />
            Max Reinhardt (1873-1943), Austrian theatrical director, was most famous in London at this time for his
            production of Karl Volmöller’s <em>The Miracle</em> (first produced 1911), which required more than 2000
            actors, musicians, dancers and other helpers, and had no dramatic dialogue. Extremely popular, the spectacle
            was revived in New York in 1924 and in London in 1932 with EW’s friend Lady Diana Cooper starring in both.
            In the 1924 production she alternated the roles of a statue of the Madonna and a troubled nun who bears a
            child. Her role as the Madonna, in which she achieved true fame, required her to stand immobile for a long
            time before coming to life to succour the nun. EW at first loathed the play - he called it ‘a disgusting
            thing’ - but later toured with it as a companion for Lady Diana.</p>

        <p><strong>55 (55) Palazzo</strong> <br />
            i.e. palace (Italian). The term can be used for any large house.</p>

        <p><strong>55 (55) Lido</strong> <br />
            The word means ‘sandbank’ but here it refers to an island reef a little distance from the city itself which
            has developed into a seaside resort.</p>

        <p><strong>55 (55) Madame Récamier</strong><span id="cap15"></span><br />
            Julie Récamier (1777-1849), French hostess of great charm and wit whose salon attracted most of the
            important political and literary figures of early 19th-century Paris. Blanche is referring to her well-known
            portrait by Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825) in the Louvre Museum in Paris, where she is seen reclining on a
            chaise longue looking over her right shoulder at us.</p>

        <p><strong>55 (55) Celtic play</strong> <br />
            The Celtic Renaissance, at least two decades old in 1923, was still attracting interest. There was however a
            certain preciousness about the solemn presentations of Celtic themes on the Dublin and London stages.</p>

        <p><strong>55 (55) Maeterlinck</strong> <br />
            Maurice Maeterlinck, Belgian playwright and writer (1862-1949), famed for his symbolist approach to
            literature. The heroine Blanche is thinking of is probably Mélisande, a fey, doomed creature in the play <a
                class="link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61075/61075-h/61075-h.htm"

            hair and losing her wedding ring in a pool.</p>

            The site of Marchmain House in St. James’s indicates how prestigious the Marchmains are. It is the very best
            area of London.</p>

            A restaurant of great repute in Paris, closed in 1954.</p>

        <p><strong>56 (56) Edwardian style</strong> <br />
            The reign of Edward VII (1901-1910) was a relaxed period after the austerities of Victoria. Among the
            characteristics of the reign was a decided preference for the delights of Paris as opposed to the propriety
            of Germany under Kaiser Wilhelm II. Many men of the upper classes thought they should imitate the King by
            sloughing off responsibility and going to the French capital to enjoy themselves, sometimes to the extent of
            creating establishments for congenial mistresses.</p>

        <p><strong>56 (56) Top Storey</strong> <br />

        <p><strong>56 (56) "<em>Bubbles</em>" </strong><span id="cap16"></span><br />
            A well-known painting by Sir John Everett Millais (1829-1896) which shows a blonde child with a clay pipe
            and a dish of soapy water watching an iridescent bubble rise into the air. When the soap firm Pears bought
            it and used it in their advertisements, the picture gained extra notoriety.</p>

        <p><strong>57 (57) Mavrodaphne Trifle</strong> <br />
            Mavrodaphne is a sweet dessert wine from Greece, here used in a trifle instead of the customary sweet
            sherry. John Fothergill at the Spreadeagle Inn, Thame, was famous for his Mavrodaphne trifle.</p>

        <p><strong>57 (58) hag-ridden</strong> <br />
            i.e. plagued by mental anguish. The term derives from the influence exerted by malevolent witches in an
            attempt to ruin the peace of mind of their victim.</p>

        <p><strong>57 (57) Corporate Communion</strong> <br />
            Clearly a new-fangled service at Charles’s college. It seems to mean no more than a Communion service for
            the whole body of the college. Today it means an ecumenical service of Communion.</p>

        <p><strong>58 (58) gowned and surpliced</strong> <br />
            Most undergraduates would wear their academic gowns for the service in the chapel; those wearing a surplice
            (a white outer garment which looks like a smock) would be assistants at the service or members of the choir.

        <p><strong>58 (58) the empty Broad ... Balliol</strong><span id="cap17"></span><br />
            <em>The Broad</em> is Broad Street. Balliol College is on Broad Street. It seems that Charles, like EW, did
            go to Hertford College (or perhaps an imaginary college next to Hertford) since he is walking away from it
            at this point.

            In 1923 this was the University chaplaincy for the Presbyterians of the University. It later developed into
            a self-governing congregation.</p>

        <p><strong>58 (59) St Aloysius</strong> <br />
            St Aloysius Gonzaga is the Roman Catholic church for the parish of Oxford. Since 1990 it has been served by
            the Oratorians, thus fulfilling Cardinal Newman’s dream of creating an Oxford Oratory, by which name the
            church is now sometimes known.</p>

        <p><strong>58 (59) Pusey House</strong><span id="cap18"></span><br />
            The University centre for Anglo-Catholic worship, as opposed to the parish centre. It is named after Edward
            Bouverie Pusey (1800-1882), a leader of the Oxford Movement from 1841. The Oxford Movement wished for a
            Catholic expression in the Church of England but Pusey House, unusually for Anglo-Catholics, maintained a
            severe, non-Roman attitude to ritual.</p>

            Forms of architecture to be found in Oxford. The Norman would be original but restored (probably badly) in
            Victorian times; the revived Gothic was a Victorian fashion under the impetus of architects like A.N.W.Pugin
            and William Butterfield; Butterfield designed Keble College (opened 1870).</p>

        <p><strong>59 (59) <em>Plays Unpleasant</em> </strong> <br />

            i.e. in Cornmarket Street, also called simply ‘the Corn’. It is one of the four main roads radiating from
            Carfax; it leads north.</p>

        <p><strong>59 (59) Clarendon Hotel</strong><span id="cap19"></span><br />
            This building in the Cornmarket was demolished in 1954 and has now been replaced by a shopping centre

            The Golden Cross is a medieval inn, the oldest in Oxford, just off Cornmarket in its own courtyard. Its
            landlord was prosecuted for selling wine on the black market in 1285. It was for centuries the property of
            New College. In ALL EW states that he joined a university club that met regularly at the Golden Cross; it
            was called the <em>White Rose Club</em> and supported the cause of the Stuart claimant to the throne of
            Great Britain.</p>

            The name given at that time to All Saints Church in the High Street. It was of broad church character and therefore considered suitable for the business and professional men of the City Council. When All Saints was made redundant in 1970 and converted over the following five years into a library for Lincoln College, St-Michael-at-the-Northgate became the City Church. The original City Church (from about 1122 to 1896) had been St. Martin’s at Carfax. The Mayor had his seat there and the Corporation appointed the Rector. St. Martin’s had been rebuilt in 1822 but was then demolished in 1896 to make room for traffic. All that remains of St Martin’s is the thirteenth-century tower now known as the Carfax Tower.</p>

            The name of the Catholic chaplaincy building, just off St Aldates in Rose Place and close to Christ Church College. It was originally medieval in origin, but its Elizabethan and Caroline features were (and remain) prominent. It got its name from being the residence of Bishop King, the only Catholic Bishop of Oxford to take up his office, in the reign of Mary I (1554-1559), though it is extremely doubtful if Bishop King ever resided there.</p>

        <p><strong>59 (60) Monsignor Bell</strong> <br />
            A monsignor is a priest of prominent position in the Roman Catholic Church who has been honoured by the Pope. The chaplain at Oxford University would be a natural candidate for the honour.</p>
        
            <p>The Catholic chaplain at Oxford at this time was actually Monsignor Arthur Stapylton Barnes, nicknamed Mugger by everybody. He had previously been chaplain at Cambridge University. He was famous for never getting flustered, whatever the situation. He fully expected undergraduates to fall away from their faith, but then to return to it after a few years’ absence. He was a sociable, well-liked man, popular with both dons and students. It was Mgr. Barnes who had moved the Catholic chaplaincy into the Old Palace in 1920, buying the site, raising the money to renovate and furnish it, and converting a large room into a chapel (they are now the chaplain’s own private rooms).</p>

        <p><strong>59 (60) the Hail Marys</strong> <br />
            The Hail Mary (Ave Maria in Latin) is a Catholic prayer which is not and never has been part of the liturgy of the mass. It was however the practice in England at the time to add prayers after the end of mass which included it. </p>
        
            <p>In 1859 Pope Pius IX had authorised these Prayers after Low Mass in his own Papal lands with the express intention of countering the claims of the Italian state to his territory. Despite this precaution, all the Pope’s lands except the Vatican City were incorporated into Italy in 1870. Pope Leo XIII extended these prayers to the whole church in 1884 (which is why they are often called the Leonine Prayers) with the wider intention that the Christian people would implore God with common prayer for that very thing which benefits the whole Christian commonwealth, but with the restoration of the papal lands as the unstated main purpose. Pope St Pius X added a three-fold invocation to the Sacred Heart in 1904. After the signing of the Lateran Treaty in 1929, an event which settled the quarrel with Italy, Pope Pius XI changed the specific intention of the Leonine Prayers to the conversion of Russia. So in 1923 Sebastian would have been ‘shouting’ for the return of the papal lands to the Pope!</p>
             
            <p>The Leonine Prayers took the form of three Hail Marys, the Salve Regina (Hail, Holy Queen), a prayer for God’s favour, a prayer for protection to Saint Michael the Archangel, and the invocation to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The words of the Hail Mary are : <br />
                <div style="margin-left: 50px;"><em>Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee; <br />
                Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus; <br />
                Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death; <br />
                Amen.</em></div></p>
