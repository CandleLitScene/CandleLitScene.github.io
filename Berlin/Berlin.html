        <p>I have recreated here the extremely enlightening annotations of David Cliffe, whose Evelyn Waugh
            website—while still accessible on <a class="link"
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160729194152/http://www.abbotshill.freeserve.co.uk/home2.htm"
                target="_blank">the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine</a>—has been offline since 2016. Since then, Mr.
            Cliffe's work has been available on<a class="link"
                href="https://bridesheadcompanion.blogspot.com/2017/05/contents.html" target="_blank"> another blog</a>
            made to house the seemingly abandoned annotations. The creator of this blog does not identify themself;
            whoever they are, I (along with, I am sure, plenty of other Brideshead readers) owe them a great deal of
            gratitude for preserving such a wonderful and helpful resource! Let us, lacking a proper name, call them Mr.
            Casaubon in honor of the obsessive tendancy to collect and organize information, a tendency I also share!
            Mr. Casaubon's blog is a lovely thing, but it is not infallible; it has a few typographic errors and, more
            importantly, is still missing some of the information from Cliffe's blog, most notably the entire
            "Chronology" section. This website is an attempt to present a more complete version of the original
            Brideshead Companion. I do not necessarily agree with everything Mr. Cliffe says—<a class="link"
                href="preface.html">see</a>, for example, his seeming insinuation in his Preface notes that the book is
            <em>not</em> a "homosexual classic"—but I nevertheless endeavour to present his work as it was on his
            website, though with the inclusion of more images, links to relevant text, and occasional editorial notes.
        </p>

        <p>I am still figuring out how to set up comments on this website. In the meantime, I ask anyone with notes,
            suggestions, questions, missives, theses, polemics, prophetations, or otherwise to contact at me through my
            email, which can be found at the bottom of the page!
